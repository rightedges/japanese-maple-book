# The 7 Groups of Japanese Maples

When faced with the thousands of cultivars of *Acer palmatum*, botanists and enthusiasts have historically categorized them into seven distinct groups. These groups are based primarily on leaf shape and growth habit. Understanding these groups is the key to identifying trees and predicting how they will perform in your garden.

## 1. Palmatum Group (The Standard)

The **Palmatum** group represents the classic Japanese Maple leaf. It is the closest to the wild type species.
*   **Leaf Shape**: Five to seven lobes. The leaf is roughly the size of a human hand.
*   **Lobes**: The divisions between the lobes (sinuses) go about halfway to two-thirds of the way to the leaf base.
*   **Habit**: Typically large, upright trees (15-25 ft).
*   **Examples**: 'Bloodgood', 'Osakazuki', 'Emperor I'.

These trees are generally the hardiest and most sun-tolerant. They form the backbone of many gardens.

## 2. Amoenum Group (The Full Moon Style)

The **Amoenum** group is defined by its "fuller" leaves.
*   **Leaf Shape**: Seven to nine lobes.
*   **Lobes**: Shallower divisions. The sinuses rarely go more than halfway to the center. The lobes themselves are often broader and less serrated than the Palmatum group.
*   **Habit**: Broad, round-headed trees.
*   **Examples**: 'Osakazuki' (often debated, fits here morphologically), 'Trompenburg'.

The word "Amoenum" means "pleasing" or "lovely," referring to the gentle, uniform look of the foliage.

## 3. Matsumurae Group (The Deeply Divided)

The **Matsumurae** group features leaves that are deeply divided, creating a more feathery, elegant look without being fully dissected.
*   **Leaf Shape**: Seven to nine lobes.
*   **Lobes**: The sinuses cut almost all the way to the petiole (leaf stem). The lobes are often narrower and have coarse serrations (teeth) along the edges.
*   **Habit**: Often naturally semi-weeping or pendulous, though some are upright.
*   **Examples**: 'Sango Kaku' (Coral Bark), 'Beni kagami', 'Omure yama'.

This group is prized for its textural contrast and graceful movement in the wind.

## 4. Dissectum Group (The Lace-Leaf)

![Acer palmatum - Dissectum Group]({{ '/assets/images/chapter2/dissectum.png' | relative_url }})

The **Dissectum** group, often called "Lace-leaf" maples, is perhaps the most beloved garden form.
*   **Leaf Shape**: The lobes are so deeply divided that they are essentially separate leaflets, and these leaflets are themselves deeply cut (sub-dissected), giving a fern-like or filigree appearance.
*   **Habit**: Almost exclusively weeping (cascading). They form mushroom-shaped mounds. They are slow-growing, rarely exceeding 6-8 feet tall but spreading 10+ feet wide.
*   **Examples**: 'Crimson Queen', 'Waterfall', 'Viridis', 'Inaba shidare'.

Because of their thin leaves, Dissectums are more prone to leaf scorch in hot, dry winds and generally prefer afternoon shade.

## 5. Linearilobum Group (The Bamboo Leaf)

![Acer palmatum - Linearilobum Group]({{ '/assets/images/chapter2/linearilobum.png' | relative_url }})

The **Linearilobum** group is the most unusual.
*   **Leaf Shape**: The lobes are extremely long and narrow, like straps or bamboo leaves.
*   **Lobes**: 5 to 7 lobes, but the "palm" is almost non-existent; the lobes radiate from the center like spokes of a wheel.
*   **Habit**: Typically upright vase-shaped trees.
*   **Examples**: 'Beni otake' (Red Bamboo), 'Koto no ito' (Harp Strings).

These create a distinct, fine texture in the landscape that contrasts beautifully with broad-leaved plants like Hostas.

## 6. Dwarf Group

The **Dwarf** group is a catch-all for cultivars selected for small stature and dense growth.
*   **Leaf Shape**: Often small, sometimes distorted or crinkled.
*   **Habit**: Slow growing, compact, often suited for rock gardens or bonsai. They may naturally form tight balls or squat bushes.
*   **Examples**: 'Mikawa yatsubusa', 'Kiyohime', 'Shishigashira' (Lion's Head).

*'Mikawa yatsubusa' is famous for its layering habit, where leaves stack upon each other like shingles.*

## 7. Variegated Group

![Acer palmatum - Variegated Group]({{ '/assets/images/chapter2/variegated.jpg' | relative_url }})

The **Variegated** group includes any maple where the leaf color feature mutli-colored patterns—white, pink, cream, or peach mixed with green or red.
*   **Leaf Shape**: Variable, can be Palmatum or Amoenum type.
*   **Habit**: Generally weaker and slower growing than solid-color counterparts because they have less chlorophyll.
*   **Examples**: 'Ukigumo' (Floating Cloud), 'Butterfly', 'Geisha Gone Wild'.

These are the divas of the maple world. They require protection from hot afternoon sun (which burns the white parts) but need enough morning light to keep the variegation vivid.
