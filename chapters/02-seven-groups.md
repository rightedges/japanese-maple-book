# The 7 Groups of Japanese Maples

Japanese maples are often classified into groups based on their leaf shape and growth habit.

1. **Palmatum**: The typical hand-like leaf.
2. **Amoenum**: Similar to Palmatum but with shallower divisions.
3. **Matsumurae**: Deeply divided lobes.
4. **Dissectum**: Lace-leaf varieties, often weeping.
5. **Linearilobum**: Very narrow, strap-like leaves.
6. **Dwarf**: Compact, small varieties.
7. **Variegated**: Leaves with multiple colors.
