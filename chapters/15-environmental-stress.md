# Environmental Stress

While pests and fungus are living threats, environmental stress is the "weathering" of the tree. Many of the most common complaints from maple owners—"My leaves are turning brown at the edges!" or "My branches are bare at the top!"—are actually physical reactions to the environment rather than a disease.

Learning to read these signs will save you from applying unnecessary (and often harmful) chemicals to your tree.

## 1. Sunscald (Leaf Scorch)
This is the number one "problem" reported by owners of lace-leaf (Dissectum) varieties.
*   **Identification**: The tips and edges of the leaves turn brown, brittle, and "crispy," usually in July or August. The interior leaves (shaded by the outer canopy) stay green.
*   **The Cause**: The tree is transpiring (losing) water through its leaves faster than its roots can pull it from the ground. The sun is literally cooking the tissue.
*   **The Cure**: Improved watering (see Chapter 5) and, if possible, temporary shade cloth during heatwaves. Most maples will recover and grow a fresh set of leaves next year.

## 2. Windburn (The Desiccator)
Japanese Maples hate strong, dry winds as much as they hate scorching sun.
*   **Identification**: Similar to sunscald, but it can happen in spring even without intense heat. The leaves look "tattered" or torn at the edges.
*   **The Cause**: High wind wicks moisture away from the leaf surface instantly, causing the cells to collapse and dry out.
*   **The Cure**: Permanent siting in a sheltered location (see Chapter 4) or planting a windbreak (hedges, etc.) to protect the tree.

## 3. Late Spring Frost Damage
This is the "heartbreaker" of the maple world.
*   **Identification**: You have a week of warm weather in March, the tree pushes out beautiful new red leaves, and then a sudden 28°F (-2°C) frost hits overnight. The next morning, the new leaves are black, mushy, and dead.
*   **The Risk**: While it looks catastrophic, the tree usually has a backup set of buds.
*   **The Cure**: If a late frost is predicted, wrap your tree in a light bedsheet or burlap overnight. Do not use plastic, as it can trap cold against the leaves.

## 4. Edema (Water Blisters)
*   **Identification**: Small, corky bumps or "warts" on the undersides of the leaves. 
*   **The Cause**: The soil is very wet, the air is very humid, and the tree takes up more water than it can transpire. The cells essentially "burst." 
*   **The Cure**: Improve drainage. This is a sign that your soil is too soggy for too long.

## 5. Bark Scorch (Southwest Injury)
*   **Identification**: The bark on the south or west side of the trunk splits or peels away, revealing the wood beneath.
*   **The Cause**: On cold winter days, the low sun warms the dark bark of the trunk, waking up the cells. Then, when the sun sets and the temperature drops instantly to freezing, the cells "freeze-dry" and die.
*   **The Cure**: Keep the trunk shaded or, for young trees, use a light-colored tree wrap in winter.

## Summary

Environmental stress is the tree's way of telling you it doesn't like its current conditions. Before you reach for a fungicide, check the sun, the wind, and the drainage. Most "scorch" issues are simply the tree's way of surviving a tough season. With patience and a little extra care (mulch and water), your maple will usually bounce back more resilient than before.
