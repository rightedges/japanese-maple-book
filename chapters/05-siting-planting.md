# Siting and Planting: Finding the Perfect Home

The most important decision you will make for your Japanese Maple happens before you even start digging. "Right Tree, Right Place" is the golden rule. A maple planted in the right spot will thrive for decades with very little help from you. A tree in the wrong spot will struggle no matter how much you care for it.

This chapter helps you find that perfect spot and shows you how to plant your tree correctly from day one.

## 1. Sunlight: The Morning Friend and Afternoon Foe

While maples need sun to grow and show off their colors, too much hot sun can burn their delicate leaves.
*   **Morning Sun is Good**: Try to find a spot that gets direct sun in the morning. This is cool light that helps the tree grow without getting too hot.
*   **Afternoon Shade is Better**: The afternoon sun (from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM) is the harshest. If possible, pick a spot where the tree is in the shadow of the house or a fence during those hot hours.
*   **The Green and Red Rule**: Generally, green-leafed maples need more shade than red-leafed ones. If your red maple turns green in summer, it might need a bit more sun!

## 2. Wind: Protect Those Delicate Leaves

Japanese Maples have very thin leaves that can dry out quickly in the wind.
*   **The Problem**: Strong wind strips the moisture away from the leaves faster than the roots can replace it. This leads to brown, "shredded" leaf edges.
*   **The Solution**: Don't plant your maple in a wide-open, windy corner. Instead, look for a spot near a fence, a wall, or other larger trees that can act as a windbreak.

## 3. Drainage: No "Wet Feet"

More Japanese Maples are killed by too much water than by too little. They hate having their roots sitting in a puddle of water.
*   **The Test**: Dig a small hole and fill it with water. If the water is still there an hour later, your soil drains too slowly.
*   **The Mound Fix**: If your ground is heavy clay and holds water, don't dig a deep hole. Instead, place the tree on top of the ground and build a "mound" of soil up around it. This ensures the main roots are always above the waterline.

## 4. How to Plant: The "Donut" Technique

When you are ready to plant, follow these simple steps:
1.  **Don't Dig Too Deep**: The hole should be wide, but keep it shallow. You want the "flare" (where the trunk becomes roots) to be visible above the ground.
2.  **Use Native Soil**: Don't fill the hole with fancy potting soil. Using the same dirt that's already in your garden forces the roots to grow out and get strong.
3.  **Water Deeply**: Once the tree is in the ground, give it a long, slow soak to settle the soil.

## Summary: Think Like a Tree

Before you plant, spend a day watching the sun and wind in your garden. Look for a spot that feels cool, protected, and has good drainage. If you build a solid foundation today, your Japanese Maple will reward you with a lifetime of effortless, spectacular beauty.
