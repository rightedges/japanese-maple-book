# Famous Cultivars Guide

With over 1,000 named cultivars of *Acer palmatum*, choosing your first (or fifth) tree can be overwhelming. While every collector has their personal favorites, a handful of varieties have risen to the top of the horticultural world due to their exceptional beauty, reliability, and distinct character. 

These are the "icons" of the Japanese Maple world.

## 1. 'Bloodgood' (The Crimson King)
If you see a red Japanese Maple in a garden, there is a 70% chance it is a 'Bloodgood'.
*   **Group**: Palmatum
*   **Color**: Deep burgundy/purple all summer, turning brilliant scarlet in the fall.
*   **Habit**: Upright and vigorous (15-20 ft). 
*   **Why it's famous**: It is remarkably sun-tolerant and holds its red color better than almost any other variety during the high heat of summer. It is the "gold standard" for upright red maples.

## 2. 'Sango Kaku' (The Coral Bark Maple)
This tree provides interest in the one season where others fade: Winter.
*   **Group**: Matsumurae
*   **Color**: Light green leaves in summer, turning a clear sun-yellow in fall.
*   **Habit**: Upright and vase-shaped (15-20 ft).
*   **Why it's famous**: The young bark turns a shocking, fluorescent coral-pink in winter. When the leaves fall, the tree looks like a sculpture made of coral. 

## 3. 'Crimson Queen' (The Weeping Queen)
The most popular of the "Dissectum" or lace-leaf varieties.
*   **Group**: Dissectum
*   **Color**: Delicate, thread-like leaves that are deep red from spring through fall.
*   **Habit**: Low, mounding, and weeping. It looks like a cascading waterfall of burgundy.
*   **Why it's famous**: It stays small (6-8 ft) and holds its color exceptionally well. It is the perfect focal point for a small garden or a large container.

## 4. 'Katsura' (The Harbinger of Spring)
For many enthusiasts, 'Katsura' is the tree that starts the year.
*   **Group**: Palmatum
*   **Color**: Emerges in spring with striking orange leaves tipped with red. In summer, it fades to a bright chartreuse green, before turning orange-yellow in fall.
*   **Habit**: Upright and bushy.
*   **Why it's famous**: Its spring color is legendary. It is often the first maple to leaf out, signaling the end of winter with its brilliant orange glow.

## 5. 'Osakazuki' (The Autumn Masterpiece)
While other trees have better spring or summer color, 'Osakazuki' wins the prize for the best autumn display.
*   **Group**: Amoenum
*   **Color**: Large, handsome green leaves all summer.
*   **Habit**: Large, round-headed tree (20-25 ft).
*   **Why it's famous**: It produces the most intense, fire-engine red fall color of any maple in existence. It is the tree that poets write about.

## 6. 'Mikawa Yatsubusa' (The Living Sculpture)
A favorite of bonsai artists and small-space gardeners.
*   **Group**: Dwarf
*   **Color**: Bright green leaves.
*   **Habit**: Extremely slow-growing and compact.
*   **Why it's famous**: The leaves grow in tight, overlapping layers (shingled), creating a dense, crinkled texture that looks like a miniature ancient forest. It is often considered the finest dwarf cultivar ever selected.

## 7. 'Ukigumo' (The Floating Cloud)
The most famous of the variegated maples.
*   **Group**: Variegated
*   **Color**: Leaves are nearly white, speckled with green and pink. 
*   **Habit**: Upright.
*   **Why it's famous**: From a distance, the tree looks like a white cloud floating in the garden. It is a "diva" that requires perfect afternoon shade, but its beauty is ethereal.

## Quick Tips for Choosing

*   **For Small Patios**: Choose a **Dissectum** (like 'Crimson Queen') or a **Dwarf** (like 'Mikawa Yatsubusa').
*   **For Winter Interest**: You can't beat **'Sango Kaku'**.
*   **For Hardiness**: Standard **Palmatum** types like 'Bloodgood' or 'Emperor I' are the toughest.
*   **For a "WOW" Factor**: Look for **'Katsura'** (Spring) or **'Osakazuki'** (Fall).
