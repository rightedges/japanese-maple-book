# Siting and Planting

You have bought the tree. You have brought it home. Now you hold its life in your hands. The decision of where and how to plant your Japanese Maple is the single most significant factor in its longevity. A cheap seedling planted correctly will outlive a thousand-dollar specimen planted poorly.

## Part 1: The Siting (Location, Location, Location)

Before you dig a shovel into the earth, you must understand the microclimate of your garden.

### The Sun/Shade Equation
The most common question is: "Can this grow in full sun?"
The answer is almost always: "It depends where you live."

*   **Cool Climates (e.g., UK, Pacific NW, New England)**: Many maples can tolerate full sun because the air temperature is moderate and humidity is often higher.
*   **Hot Climates (e.g., Texas, California, Southern France)**: The afternoon sun is a death ray. It will scorch leaves faster than the roots can pump water.

**The Golden Rule**: *Morning Sun, Afternoon Shade.*
Ideally, position the tree where it gets sun from dawn until 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM, and is shaded by a house, fence, or larger tree during the hottest part of the day (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM).

### The Compass Guide (Aspect)
Which way your planting site faces determines its suitability.

*   **East-Facing (The Gold Standard)**: This is the ideal location for 90% of Japanese Maples. It receives the gentle, cool morning sun which dries the dew (preventing fungal issues) but is shaded by the house or wall during the scorching afternoon hours.
*   **North-Facing (The Safe Haven)**: Offers the coolest conditions with consistent shade. This is perfect for the sensitive "Variegated" group (like 'Ukigumo') or "Full Moon" maples which scorch easily. However, in deep shade, red trees may turn green and fall color might be less intense.
*   **South-Facing (The Heat Trap)**: This is high-risk. A south-facing wall reflects heat, creating a microclimate often 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the garden. Only plant the toughest cultivars here (e.g., 'Seiryu', 'Bloodgood') and ensure they are well-mulched and watered.
*   **West-Facing (The Danger Zone)**: This aspect receives the late afternoon sun (3 PM - 7 PM), which coincides with the hottest air temperatures of the day. This combination is lethal for delicate leaves. Avoid planting dissectums or variegated maples here unless they are shaded by a larger tree.

### Wind Protection
Recall that *Acer palmatum* is an understory tree. It hates consistent, drying wind.
*   **Hot Wind**: Causes leaf scorch (crispy edges) even if the soil is wet.
*   **Cold Wind**: Causes twig dieback in winter.
*   **Placement**: Plant near a windbreak (hedge, wall) but not so close that it radiates heat. Avoid the corners of houses where wind tunnels form.

## Part 2: The Soil

Japanese Maples are not bog plants. They are susceptible to *Phytophthora* (root rot). They need **moist, well-draining soil**.

### The "Clay Bowl" Effect
If you have heavy clay soil, digging a hole is essentially making a swimming pool. If you fill that hole with loose, fluffy potting soil and plant your tree, water will flow into the hole, get trapped by the clay walls, and drown the roots.

**The Test**: Dig a hole 12 inches deep. Fill it with water. If it hasn't drained in 12 hours, you have poor drainage.

### The Solution: Plant High (Mound Planting)
If you have poor drainage or heavy clay, **do not plant level with the ground**.
Instead, plant on a mound.
1.  Set the root ball on the existing ground (or in a very shallow depression).
2.  Bring in good topsoil to build a varying mound *around* the roots.
3.  This ensures the crown of the root system is always above the water table.

## Part 3: The Planting Process

### 1. Digging the Hole
*   **Width**: Dig wide. 2 to 3 times the width of the root ball.
*   **Depth**: Dig shallow. The hole should be *shallower* than the root ball. You want the "root flare" (where trunk meets roots) to sit 1-2 inches **above** the surrounding soil level.

### 2. Root Preparation
Remove the pot. If the roots are circling around the outside (pot-bound), you **must** tease them out.
*   Use your fingers or a hand rake (a root hook) to loosen the outer roots.
*   If they are severely matted, take a sterile knife and make 3-4 vertical slices down the sides of the root ball. This sounds aggressive, but it stimulates new root growth outward into the native soil.

### 3. Placing and Backfilling
Place the tree in the center. Rotate it to find its "best face."
*   **Backfill**: Use the native soil you dug out.
*   **Amendments**: Do not fill the hole with bags of compost or peat moss. This creates a texture difference that stops roots from leaving the hole. You want the tree to adapt to your native soil. You can mix in a *small* amount (20%) of pine bark conditioner to improve aeration, but mostly use native soil.

### 4. Watering In
Fill the hole halfway with soil, then flood it with water to settle air pockets. Then fill the rest. Do not stomp on the soil with your boots; this compacts the earth and crushes delicate roots. Press firmly with your hands.

### 5. The Don'ts
*   **Do Not** bury the trunk. The bark will rot.
*   **Do Not** put fertilizer in the planting hole. It can burn sensitive roots. Wait until the tree is established (usually the next spring).

A well-planted Japanese Maple looks slightly elevated, like it is sitting on a small throne. This "throne" allows oxygen to reach the roots and excess water to drain away—the two secrets to a happy maple.
