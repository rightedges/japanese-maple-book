# Buying Your First Tree

## What to look for

When visiting a nursery, look for:
- A straight central leader (unless it's a weeping variety).
- Balanced branching structure.
- No signs of injury to the bark.

## Root Flares and Grafts

Most Japanese Maples are grafted. Inspect the graft union to ensure it is fully healed and clean. Check the root flare to make sure the tree hasn't been planted too deep.
