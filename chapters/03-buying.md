# Buying Your First Tree

Embarking on the journey of Japanese Maple stewardship begins with a single, crucial moment: the purchase. While impulse buying so often plagues gardeners ("I have a spot for this somewhere!"), selecting a Japanese Maple requires a discerning eye. You are not just buying a plant; you are buying a structure, a root system, and a genetic history.

## Where to Shop: Specialists vs. Big Box

The first decision is where to source your tree.

### The Big Box Store
Local garden centers and hardware chains will often carry a generic selection: usually 'Bloodgood', 'Crimson Queen', and standard green seedlings.
*   **Pros**: Accessibility and sometimes lower price.
*   **Cons**: Often mislabeled. A "Bloodgood" at a big box store is frequently just a random red seedling that will turn green by July. The care in the nursery holding area is often poor (overwatered or sun-scorched).

### The Specialist Nursery
For the true enthusiast, online specialist nurseries or dedicated local maple growers are the gold standard.
*   **Pros**: Correct variety identification. They carry hundreds of rare cultivars. Trees are treated with specific knowledge of the species.
*   **Cons**: Higher cost, especially with shipping. Smaller starter sizes (1-gallon or "tubes") are common.

## Evaluating the Tree: A 3-Point Inspection

When you are standing in front of a tree (or looking at photos online), inspect it from the ground up.

### 1. The Root Flare (Nebari)
The most common killer of trees is planting too deep. Look at the base of the trunk. It should flare out slightly where it enters the soil. If the trunk looks like a telephone pole going straight into the ground, it is buried too deep.
*   **Action**: Gently brush away the top half-inch of soil. If you find circling roots (girdling roots) choking the trunk, pick another tree.

### 2. The Branch Structure
Look for a clean "central leader" (for upright trees). Avoid trees with "included bark"—narrow V-shaped crotches where two trunks compete. These weak unions are liable to split in heavy snow or wind.
*   **Good**: Branches leaving the trunk at wide angles (45-90 degrees).
*   **Bad**: Crossing branches that rub against each other.

### 3. The Bark
Inspect for damage. Any nicks or weed-whacker damage at the base are entry points for fungal pathogens like Verticillium.

## The Great Debate: Grafted vs. Own-Root Trees

One of the most confusing aspects for beginners is the concept of grafting. Almost every Japanese Maple cultivar you buy is a **clone**.

### Genetic Instability and Cloning
As mentioned in Chapter 1, *Acer palmatum* is genetically unstable. If you plant a seed from a 'Bloodgood', the baby tree will not be a 'Bloodgood'. It might be red, it might be green, or it might be a muddy bronze. It is simply a generic *Acer palmatum*.

To preserve the specific traits of a cultivar (like the coral bark of 'Sango Kaku' or the lace leaves of 'Crimson Queen'), we must clone it. This is done by **grafting**: taking a cutting (scion) from the desired tree and splicing it onto the roots (rootstock) of a generic, vigorous seedling.

### For the Landscape Gardener: Grafting is Good
For 95% of gardeners, a grafted tree is exactly what you want.
*   **Vigor**: The seedling rootstock is chosen for power. It pushes the fancy top growth faster than it would grow on its own roots.
*   **Uniformity**: You know exactly what you are getting.
*   **The Graft Union**: This is the scar on the trunk where the two trees were joined. In a high-quality tree, this graft is low, clean, and nearly invisible after a few years. In a low-quality tree, it is high, ugly, and creates a "dog-leg" kink in the trunk.

### For the Bonsai Artist: Grafting is (Usually) Bad
If your goal is bonsai—the art of growing miniature trees in containers—the rules change entirely.
*   **The Aesthetic Flaw**: In bonsai, the transition from root to trunk (nebari) is the most critical aesthetic feature. A bulbous, scarred graft union ruins this flow. It looks artificial and breaks the illusion of a giant, ancient tree.
*   **Reverse Taper**: Over time, the aggressive rootstock often thickens faster than the delicate scion on top. This creates "reverse taper," where the trunk gets *thinner* as you go up, which is the opposite of how natural trees grow.

**The Bonsai Solution**:
Bonsai practitioners prefer trees on their **own roots**. They achieve this by:
1.  **Air Layering**: Forcing roots to grow on a branch of a mature cultivar, then cutting that branch off to make a new, graft-free tree.
2.  **Cuttings**: Rooting soft-wood cuttings (though maples can be stubborn).
3.  **Seedlings**: Accepting the genetic variability and enjoying the unique, wild character of a generic mountain maple (*yamamomiji*).

## Transport and Acclimation

Once you buy the tree, do not throw it in the back of an open pickup truck and drive 70mph down the highway. The wind burn will desiccate the leaves in minutes.
*   **Transport**: Put it inside the car. If it must go in a truck bed, wrap the canopy in burlap or lay it down flat out of the wind.
*   **Acclimation**: When you get home, place the tree in a shady, protected spot for a week. Do not plant it immediately in full sun. It needs time to adjust from the nursery environment to your garden's microclimate.

Buying a tree is a commitment of time. Choose widely, inspect closely, and understand the biology of what you are bringing home.
