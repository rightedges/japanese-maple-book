# Introduction to *Acer palmatum*

## What makes a Japanese Maple?

*Acer palmatum*, commonly known as the Japanese Maple, is a species of woody plant native to Japan, Korea, China, eastern Mongolia, and southeast Russia.

## Natural habitat and biology

In their natural habitat, they grow as understory trees, often shaded by larger canopy trees. This informs much of their care requirements in cultivation, particularly their preference for dappled shade and protection from harsh afternoon sun.
