This table provides a snapshot comparison of some of the most popular Japanese Maples. Use it to quickly find a tree that fits your site requirements.

| Cultivar Name | Group | Foliage Color (Sum/Fall) | Mature Habit | Sun Tolerance | Best Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **'Bloodgood'** | Palmatum | Burgundy / Scarlet | Upright (15-20') | High | Remarkable color retention. Robust and sun-tolerant, but requires very well-drained soil. |
| **'Sango Kaku'** | Matsumurae | Green / Gold | Upright (15-20') | Moderate | Coral-red winter bark. Needs sun for red bark, but foliage is sensitive to hot afternoon sun and dry winds. |
| **'Crimson Queen'** | Dissectum | Burgundy / Red | Weeping (6-8') | Moderate | Fine lacy texture. Requires shelter from prevailing winds and dappled shade to prevent tip burn. |
| **'Katsura'** | Palmatum | Chartreuse / Orange | Upright (10-12') | Moderate | Stunning orange spring growth. Forms a dense, tiered structure; prune for air circulation to prevent mildew. |
| **'Osakazuki'** | Amoenum | Green / Fire-Red | Upright (20-25') | High | World-class fall color. A "green giant" for 10 months, but becomes the garden star in November. |
| **'Mikawa Yatsubusa'** | Dwarf | Green / Orange | Dwarf (3-5') | Moderate | Unique shingled habit. Extremely slow-growing; ideal for containers and focal points in rock gardens. |
| **'Seiryu'** | Dissectum | Green / Gold-Red | Upright (10-15') | High | Elegant upright lace-leaf. Very vigorous for a dissectum; tolerates heat better than weeping varieties. |
| **'Beni maiko'** | Palmatum | Red-Green / Scarlet | Bushy (6-8') | Moderate | Brilliant "Red Dance" spring color. Needs protection from late spring frosts to protect first flush. |
| **'Ukigumo'** | Variegated | White-Green / Pink | Upright (8-10') | **Low (Shade)** | Ethereal "floating cloud" look. Requires deep shade; white leaf portions burn instantly in direct sun. |
| **'Shishigashira'** | Palmatum | Deep Green / Orange | Upright (8-12') | High | "Lion's Head" crinkled foliage. Holds leaves very late into autumn; best used as a vertical architectural element. |
| **'Inaba shidare'** | Dissectum | Deep Purple / Red | Weeping (6-8') | High | Exceptional vigor. Most sun-tolerant of the red lace-leafs; excellent for larger weeping specimens. |
| **'Summer Gold'** | Palmatum | Golden Yellow / Gold | Upright (8-10') | High | Vibrant yellow focal point. Retains its golden-yellow color even in the full sun of July and August. |
| **'Jordan'** | Shirasawanum | Neon Yellow / Orange | Upright (10-12') | Moderate | Pastel neon foliage. Needs morning sun for best color, but afternoon shade is critical in hot regions. |
| **'Scolopendrifolium'** | Linearilobum | Green / Gold | Upright (12-15') | Moderate | Dramatic "willow" look. Long, narrow lobes move beautifully in the wind; provides an airy light filter. |
| **'Butterfly'** | Variegated | White-Green / Pink-Red| Upright (8-12') | Moderate | Best hardy variegated variety. More resilient than 'Ukigumo'; stays compact with light structural pruning. |
| **'Tamukeyama'** | Dissectum | Purple-Red / Scarlet | Weeping (6-8') | High | Heat resilience master. The preferred red lace-leaf for the American South due to soil/heat tolerance. |

## Note on Hardiness
Almost all cultivars listed above are hardy to **USDA Zones 5-9**. However, for container-grown trees, remember the "2-Zone Rule" (see Chapter 6).
