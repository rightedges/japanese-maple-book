# Maintenance Calendar

To make the care of your Japanese Maple easier, here is a month-by-month guide. Bookmark this page for quick reference throughout the year.

---

## Winter (The Season of Structure)

### January
*   **Protection**: Keep an eye on the forecast. Move pots into the garage if temperatures drop near 15°F (-9°C).
*   **Pruning**: Best time for major structural pruning on dormant, leafless trees.

### February
*   **Planning**: Order new trees from specialty nurseries before the spring rush.
*   **Winter Bark**: Enjoy the coral-red bark of your Sango Kaku maples against the snow.

## Spring (The Season of Rebirth)

### March
*   **Bud Break**: Watch for the first signs of swelling buds. This is the signal for the year to begin.
*   **Potting**: Re-pot container trees and root-prune before the leaves open.
*   **Planting**: Start planting in-ground trees as soon as the soil is workable.

### April
*   **Fertilizing**: Apply your light, organic slow-release feed (see Chapter 7).
*   **Spring Color**: Take photos—the emergent colors of spring often last only a few weeks!
*   **Protection**: Have your burlap or bedsheets ready for sudden late frosts.

### May
*   **Pests**: Check the undersides of new leaves for aphids. Blast them off with a hose.
*   **Watering**: As temperatures rise, start checking your pots daily using the "Finger Test."

## Summer (The Season of Resilience)

### June
*   **Pruning**: Remove "water sprouts" (long, straight, vertical shoots) that are cluttering the interior.
*   **Mulching**: Ensure your 3-inch "donut" of mulch is intact to keep roots cool.

### July
*   **Watering**: The high-risk month. Potted trees may need water daily. In-ground trees should get a deep soak once or twice a week during dry spells.
*   **Shade**: Provide temporary afternoon shade for delicate varieties during intense heatwaves.

### August
*   **Fertilizing**: **STOP ALL FEEDING.** You do not want the tree to push out new tender growth this late in the year.
*   **Observation**: Note any sunscald or leaf scorch. If the tree is burning, plan to move it to a more sheltered spot in the autumn.

---

## Autumn (The Season of Fire)

### September
*   **Air Layering**: Check your air layers from spring. If they are full of roots, harvest them and pot them up.
*   **Watering**: Do not slack off yet. The tree is preparing for its final show and needs hydration to fuel the chemistry of fall color.

### October
*   **The Show**: Enjoy the peak colors! This is the highlight of the year.
*   **Cleanup**: If your tree had fungal issues, rake up and dispose of the fallen leaves to prevent the spores from overwintering.

### November
*   **Dormancy**: As the leaves fall, the tree enters its rest period.
*   **Winterizing**: Wrap the trunks of young trees to prevent "Southwest Injury" (bark scorch).

### December
*   **Rest**: Let the tree sleep. 
*   **Gifts**: A high-quality pair of Japanese pruning shears makes a wonderful gift for any maple enthusiast!

By following this calendar, you work *with* the tree's natural cycle rather than against it. Each month brings its own tasks and its own unique beauty.
