# Pests and Diseases

Japanese Maples are generally hardy trees, but like all living things, they are subject to "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." Identifying a problem early is the difference between losing a single twig and losing the entire tree.

In many cases, the "symptoms" you see are not the primary problem, but a secondary reaction to environmental stress (too much water, too much sun, etc.). A healthy, well-sited tree is its own best defense.

## 1. The Pests

### Aphids (Sap-Suckers)
*   **Identification**: Small, soft-bodied insects (usually green, red, or black) clustered on the undersides of new leaves or tender shoots. Leaves may look curled or sticky (Honeydew).
*   **The Harm**: They suck the sap, weakening the growth and potentially spreading viruses.
*   **Treatment**: Usually, a strong blast of water from a hose will knock them off. For persistent infestations, use **Neem Oil** or insecticidal soap. 

### Scale
*   **Identification**: Small, waxy "bumps" on the bark. They don't look like insects at first glance.
*   **The Harm**: Like aphids, they suck sap.
*   **Treatment**: Horticultural oil in the winter (when the tree is dormant) is the most effective way to smother them.

## 2. The Diseases (The Scary Stuff)

### Verticillium Wilt (The Sudden Death)
This is a soil-borne fungus that enters through the roots and clogs the tree's vascular system (the plumbing).
*   **Identification**: A single branch or one side of the tree suddenly wilts and dies while the rest of the tree looks fine. If you cut into the dead branch, you will often see a dark, streaky "ring" or stain in the wood.
*   **Treatment**: There is no chemical cure. 
    1.  Prune out the dead wood (sterilizing your tools after EVERY cut).
    2.  Fertilize with the proper low-nitrogen feed and water consistently to help the tree out-grow the infection.
    3.  If a tree dies from this, do not plant another Japanese Maple in that same spot.

### Pseudomonas (Bacterial Blight)
Known by many as "Black Tip."
*   **Identification**: New shoots turn black and die back during cold, wet springs. It usually happens in the outer canopy.
*   **Treatment**: Prune off the black tips several inches into healthy green wood. Copper-based fungicides can be used as a preventative in late autumn or early spring, but the best cure is better airflow and sun.

### Root Rot (Phytophthora)
The result of poor drainage (as discussed in Chapter 4).
*   **Identification**: The whole tree looks stunted, leaves stay small, and the roots turn black and mushy instead of white and firm.
*   **Treatment**: Improve drainage immediately. In pots, move to a coarser soil mix. In the ground, transplant to a mound.

## General Prevention

*   **Airflow**: Don't crowd your maples. Air moving through the branches dries out the leaves and prevents fungus from taking hold.
*   **Cleanliness**: Always pick up fallen leaves in the autumn if your tree had a fungal issue during the summer.
*   **The Right Site**: A tree struggling in the wrong location is a magnet for pests.

Do not panic at the first sign of a spotty leaf. Maples often shed many of their imperfections as the seasons change. But keep an eye on the "Big Three" (Verticillium, Pseudomonas, and Root Rot), as these require immediate action to save the life of the tree.
