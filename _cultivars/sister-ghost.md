## Overview
'Sister Ghost' offers a more subtle but no less beautiful version of the reticulated Ghost variegation. Its colors are cooler, focusing on chartreuse and soft greens.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with soft chartreuse leaves and deep, emerald green veins. The effect is cool and calming.
- **Summer**: The contrast between the veins and leaf field remains, giving the tree a textured, layered look.
- **Fall**: Turns a luminous lemon-yellow to golden-orange.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal for a calm, cool-toned shade garden. Its smaller size makes it perfect for courtyard gardens or as a high-texture specimen.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Protection**: Like all Ghosts, it performs best in bright, indirect light or dappled shade.
- **Minimal Pruning**: Naturally maintains a graceful, upright shape.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Sister Ghost' is often the favorite of those who find 'First Ghost' or 'Amber Ghost' too dramatic, offering a more refined and understated elegance.
