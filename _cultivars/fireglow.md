## Overview
'Fireglow' is named for its incredible ability to "glow" when backlit by the sun. It is a more compact and slower-growing alternative to 'Bloodgood', making it ideal for smaller gardens.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges a bright, intense red.
- **Summer**: The leaves are thinner and more translucent than many red maples, allowing light to pass through and create a glowing effect. It holds its red color very well in the heat.
- **Fall**: A spectacular finish in brilliant scarlet and orange-red.

## Garden Use & Care
Perfect as a focal point in a small garden or as a high-impact specimen in a mixed border. Its compact size makes it more manageable than larger upright cultivars.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Positioning**: Best planted where it will be backlit by morning or afternoon sun to fully appreciate its name.
- **Soil**: Requires well-drained soil rich in organic matter.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Fireglow' is often preferred over 'Bloodgood' for smaller spaces due to its more manageable size and intense, glowing color.
