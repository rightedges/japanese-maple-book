## Overview
'Peve Starfish' is a unique and relatively new cultivar known for its unusual leaf shape. The lobes of the leaves curl downward at the margins, resembling the legs of a starfish, which gives the entire tree a distinct, textured appearance.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Bright maroon-red leaves emerge, showing off their unique curled shape early.
- **Summer**: Maintains a deep burgundy-purple color that is exceptionally resistant to fading in the sun.
- **Fall**: Transitions to a brilliant, glowing scarlet red.

## Garden Use & Care
With its compact, upright habit, it is an excellent choice for smaller landscapes or as a focal point where its unique leaf structure can be viewed up close.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Exposure**: Best color is achieved in full sun, though it is quite adaptable.
- **Drainage**: Like all Japanese Maples, it requires well-draining soil to prevent root issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 'Peve Starfish' is noted for its ability to hold its deep red color even in the humid and hot summers of the eastern United States.
