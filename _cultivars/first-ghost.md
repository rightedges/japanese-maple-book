## Overview
'First Ghost' is the original and perhaps most famous of the "Ghost" series developed by Buchholz & Buchholz. It is prized for its dramatic reticulated variegation, where the veins are a stark, dark green against a much lighter leaf field.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with creamy white to pale green leaves featuring prominent dark green veins. The tips often show a soft pink or red flush.
- **Summer**: The variegation remains striking but may soften; the leaf field becomes more chartreuse.
- **Fall**: Transitions to beautiful yellows and oranges, often with the veins still visible.

## Garden Use & Care
An absolute "must-have" for collectors and lovers of variegated plants. It must be planted in a shaded, protected spot to prevent leaf burn.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Deep Shade**: This is a true shade lover. Direct afternoon sun will ruin the delicate white portions of the leaves.
- **Airflow**: Ensure good airflow to prevent fungal issues in the shade.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The 'Ghost' series maples are "high-maintenance" maples that reward the gardener with an ethereal, hauntingly beautiful appearance.
