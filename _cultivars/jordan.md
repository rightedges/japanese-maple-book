## Overview
'Jordan' is a spectacular Full Moon Maple (*Acer shirasawanum*) known for its extraordinary luminosity and vigorous growth. It features massive, rounded, pleated leaves that resemble hand-fans, providing a tropical, neon-bright chartreuse texture that thrives far better than older yellow varieties like 'Aureum'.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerge as neon lemon-lime fans, often brushed with soft apricot-orange at the margins.
- **Summer**: Maintains a saturated chartreuse with striking red upright seeds ("samaras") providing a stunning contrast.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions through a "halo" effect to fiery orange and gold. Pale grey bark and tiered horizontal branching define its winter presence.

## Garden Use & Care
Functions as a "visual spotlight" in shaded or wooded areas. Its tropical texture makes it a perfect bridge plant for gardens featuring palms or large ferns. Pair with **Blue Hostas** for a classic high-design look.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Wind Protection**: Large fan-like leaves can "shred" in high winds; always plant in a sheltered location.
- **Watering**: Because of its high surface area, it requires significantly more water than fine-leafed cultivars during establishment.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure at least 3-4 hours of morning sun to trigger the vibrant red color in the seeds, which is the tree's most underrated feature.
