## Overview
An *Acer shirasawanum* variety, 'Jordan' is famous for its nearly neon pastel-yellow foliage. The leaves are large and "full-moon" shaped, providing a completely different texture from the *palmatum* varieties.

## Care Tips
- **Afternoon Shade:** Critical in hot regions. While it needs morning sun for the best neon color, the large leaves are prone to scorching in the intense heat of the afternoon.
- **Spring Flush:** Features small but attractive matching yellow-green flowers.
- **Fall Interest:** Turns a stunning orange-red in the fall, often with yellow highlights.
