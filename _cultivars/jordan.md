## Overview
'Jordan' is arguably the most spectacular of the Full Moon Maples (*Acer shirasawanum*). While the legendary 'Aureum' was the previous standard for yellow Full Moons, 'Jordan' has largely replaced it in modern collections due to its significantly higher vigor, its larger, neon-bright leaves, and its much better resilience to the sun. It features massive, rounded, pleated leaves that resemble hand-fans, providing a tropical, jungle-like texture that is rare in temperate trees. To see a mature 'Jordan' in the dappled light of a morning garden is to see one of the most intense biological colors in the world.

## 1. Cultural Context & Historical Anecdotes
Named after the son of the **Fratelli Gilardelli** nursery owner in Italy (the same horticultural pioneers who gave us 'Summer Gold'), 'Jordan' was selected in the late **2000s** for its extraordinary luminosity. It is a member of the *Shirasawanum* group, which differs from the standard *Palmatum* group primarily in its leaf structure: the leaves have more lobes (usually 9-13) and are more rounded and "closed" in their arrangement.

In Japan, Full Moon Maples are often associated with the autumn moon, but 'Jordan' is a tree for the spring and summer. It was bred to solve the "slowness" of 'Aureum'. While 'Aureum' could take 30 years to reach 6 feet, 'Jordan' is a vigorous grower that can reach that height in half the time, making it a "real-world" tree for modern homeowners.

## 2. Seasonal Transitions: Layer by Layer
'Jordan' offers a light-filled, highly textural performance throughout the year:

- **Spring Flush (The Neon Moon)**: The leaves emerge as clusters of bright, neon lemon-lime. They are large and look like delicate, folded paper fans. During the first few weeks, the margins may be brushed with a soft apricot-orange. The color is so bright that it can make other green plants in the garden look "dingy" by comparison.
- **Summer Maturation**: Throughout July, the neon intensity "mellows" into a bright, saturated chartreuse. The leaves are thick and leathery for a Full Moon maple, which helps them hold their pleated shape even in the humidity. The tree produces bright red "samaras" (seeds) that stand vertically on the branches, providing a stunning red-on-yellow contrast in early summer.
- **Autumn Finale**: In October, 'Jordan' transitions into a firework display of orange and red. The transition usually begins at the edges of the neon leaves, creating a "halo" effect where the center is still yellow and the rim is a bright pumpkin-orange. It eventually finishes in a solid, warm gold-red.
- **Winter Silhouette**: The bark is pale grey and exceptionally smooth. The tree forms a wide, upright, and somewhat tiered branching habit. The "Shirasawanum" structure is naturally more "horizontal" than "vertical," creating a wide-canopy look that provides great presence in the winter garden.

## 3. Design Use & Companion Planting
### Landscape Role
- **The Shaded Spotlight**: Use 'Jordan' to create a visual "break" in a dark or heavily wooded part of the garden. Its large, light-colored leaves act as a giant reflector.
- **Tropical Texture Anchor**: If you are designing a "faux-tropical" garden with palms or large ferns, 'Jordan' is the perfect temperate tree to bridge the gap. Its massive fan-like leaves fit the aesthetic perfectly.

### Companion Planting & Understory
- **Blue & Silver Complement**: Pair with **Blue Hosta** 'Elegans' or **Blue Fescue Grass**. The neon chartreuse of 'Jordan' and the powdery blue of the hosta is a "designer's favorite" color combination.
- **Dark Textures**: Plant near **Purple-Leaved Smokebush** (*Cotinus coggygria*) or dark-leaved **Rhododendrons**. The dark purple background is essential to make the neon yellow of 'Jordan' truly "vibrate."
- **Groundcover**: A thick carpet of **Japanese Forest Grass** (*Hakonechloa macra* 'Aureola') creates a "flowing" yellow base that mirrors the architectural yellow canopy above.

## 4. Advanced Horticultural Notes
- **Lobe Count and Hybrid Vigor**: Horticulturally, 'Jordan' is valued because it combines the multi-lobed beauty of a Shirasawanum with the vigor of a Palmatum hybrid. It is much more "forgiving" of varying root conditions than the species type.
- **Sun Strategy**: While 'Jordan' is more sun-tolerant than 'Aureum', its leaves are still large and have a high surface area for evaporation. In Zone 8-9, it **must** have afternoon shade. Without it, the large leaves will tatter and develop "bleached out" spots in the center.
- **Grafting Compatibility**: It is highly compatible with *Acer palmatum* rootstock, which is lucky for gardeners because Palmatum rootstock is much hardier than Shirasawanum rootstock. Ensure the graft is well-established before planting in the ground.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Variety-Specific Issues
- **The "Wind Shred"**: Because the leaves are so large and fan-like, they act like little sails. In high winds, they can "shred" or tear along the pleats. 
    - *Action*: Always plant 'Jordan' in a sheltered location, away from the prevailing "wind tunnel" paths between buildings.
- **Water Consumption**: A tree with leaves this large "drinks" significantly more water than a fine-leafed dissectum. During the first two years of establishment, it cannot be allowed to dry out even once.
- **Late Spring Frost**: Like all early bloomers, 'Jordan' is vulnerable to "tip kill" from late frosts. 
    - *Action*: Keep a frost cloth ready once the "neon fans" begin to unfurl.

> [!TIP]
> To get the best red seed (samara) display, ensure the tree receives at least 3-4 hours of morning sun. The sunlight triggers the red pigment in the seeds, which is one of the most underrated features of this cultivar.
