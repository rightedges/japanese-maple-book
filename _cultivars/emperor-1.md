## Overview
'Emperor 1' is often considered the "improved Bloodgood." It was selected for its ability to leaf out about two weeks later than 'Bloodgood', effectively avoiding the late spring frosts that can damage other red maples.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with a dark, rich red color that is very translucent when backlit.
- **Summer**: Maintains a deep burgundy-purple color, even in hot climates, resisting the "greening out" common in other red cultivars.
- **Fall**: Turns a brilliant, glowing scarlet.

## Garden Use & Care
An excellent choice for a specimen tree where reliable red color is desired. Its slightly faster growth rate and frost resistance make it a favorite for many landscapes.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Pruning**: Responds well to thinning to maintain its upright, vase-like shape and airy feel.
- **Location**: Thrives in full sun to partial shade.

> [!TIP]
> Use 'Emperor 1' in areas prone to late spring frosts where other Japanese Maples have struggled.
