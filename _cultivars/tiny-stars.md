## Overview
'Tiny Stars' is an extremely small, dwarf cultivar that produces leaves no larger than a thumbnail. It is a slow-growing plant that forms a dense, compact mound of green stars.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Thousands of tiny, bright green star-shaped leaves emerge on congested branchlets.
- **Summer**: The green foliage remains tight and dense, creating a moss-like appearance from a distance.
- **Fall**: Turns a surprising and brilliant orange-red to scarlet.

## Garden Use & Care
The perfect cultivar for bonsai, rock gardens, or small troughs and containers. Its slow growth means it will never outgrow its space.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Patience**: This is an extremely slow-growing plant; do not expect much height for several years.
- **Protection**: Its small size makes it vulnerable to being stepped on or buried by mulch; ensure its location is "safe" and elevated.

> [!TIP]
> 'Tiny Stars' is a favorite for fairy gardens and miniature landscapes due to its perfect "miniature tree" proportions.
