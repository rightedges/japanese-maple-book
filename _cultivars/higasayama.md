## Overview
'Higasayama' is a classic cultivar (known since the 1800s) famous for a unique "gimmick." The buds peel back to reveal leaves that are tightly pleated and curled like exotic flowers. As they unfurl, they display dazzling margins of cream and hot pink against a green center.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: The main event. The unfolding leaves look like white and pink popcorn popping on the branches.
- **Summer**: Variegation settles into creamy margins on dark green leaves.
- **Fall**: A reliable mix of yellow, orange, and red.
- **Form**: Very vertical and vase-shaped when young, broadening with age.

## Garden Use & Care
A conversation piece. Plant it near a walkway where the intricate spring unfolding can be viewed daily.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Reversion**: Can occasionally throw solid green branches. These should be removed promptly to maintain the variegated energy of the tree.
- **Sun**: Surprisingly tough and handles full sun well, which intensifies the pink tones.
