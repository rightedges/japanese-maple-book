## Overview
'Shishigashira' ("Lion's Head") is a sculptural masterpiece known for its dense, crinkled foliage that resembles the mane of a mythical Japanese lion. A slow-growing upright with an ancient gravitas, it is prized for its structural power and unapologetic "thick" appearance.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Bright apple-green emergence matures into a deep, leathery green. Its dense nodes create "thick ropes" of foliage that are remarkably heat-resistant.
- **Fall & Winter**: One of the last to change, turning a glowing golden-orange in late November. Winter reveals a stiff, muscular grey bark structure that looks like modern bronze sculpture.
- **Urban Utility**: Its rugged nature makes it equally at home in high-maintenance bonsai pots or as a multi-story specimen in public parks.

## Garden Use & Care
Functions as a perfect "entryway sentinel" or a standalone focal point for minimalist modern gardens. Pair with soft-textured **Mexican Feather Grass** for a stunning textural counterpoint.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Aphid Management**: Crinkled leaves are a hotspot for pests; use a high-pressure water nozzle to rinse the interior of clumps monthly in spring.
- **Branch Care**: Branches are "stiff" rather than flexible; keep away from roof-lines where falling ice or heavy snow could cause snapping.

> [!TIP]
> At 10 years old, 'Shishigashira' becomes a true lifetime investment and the most talked-about architectural element in any garden.
