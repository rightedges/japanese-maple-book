## Overview
A legendary cultivar known for its unique, crinkled deep-green foliage that grows in dense tufts along the branches, resembling a lion's mane. It is an architectural masterpiece in the garden.

## Care Tips
- **Fall Retention:** Holds its leaves later into autumn than almost any other maple, eventually turning a brilliant gold and orange.
- **Structure:** Naturally grows in a slow, upright, and somewhat stiff habit. It is highly prized by bonsai artists.
- **Sun:** Very sun-tolerant and robust once established.
