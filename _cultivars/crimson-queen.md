## Overview
'Crimson Queen' is widely regarded as one of the finest red lace-leaf (dissectum) maples ever discovered. It is the gold standard for mounding, weeping forms, prized not just for its exquisite, feathery texture, but for its legendary ability to hold a deep, consistent burgundy-red color from early spring through the hottest days of summer. While other dissectums may "fade to bronze" or "green out," 'Crimson Queen' maintains her regal hue with steadfast reliability.

## 1. Cultural Context & Historical Anecdotes
The story of 'Crimson Queen' begins in **1965** at the **Cascio Nursery** in New Jersey. At the time, the world of red lace-leaf maples was dominated by seed-grown varieties that were notoriously unstable. A young tree in the nursery caught the eye of the breeders—it was hardier than its peers and its color was significantly more intense.

Naming it 'Crimson Queen' was a bold marketing move that paid off, as it quickly became the most requested weeping maple in the United States and Europe. It proved that a *Dissectum* could be both elegant and "tough," bridging the gap between delicate collector plants and reliable garden workhorses.

## 2. Seasonal Transitions: Layer by Layer
The "Queen" offers a sophisticated color progression that defines the garden's mood:

- **Spring Emergence**: The leaves unfurl like tiny, red spiders. The color is a bright, clear carmine. Because the leaves are so finely dissected, they catch the low spring light in a way that makes the entire tree appear like a soft, red fog hovering over the ground.
- **Summer Maturation**: During the high heat of July, the foliage deepens into a rich, velvety burgundy. This "hardening off" process gives the leaves a slightly waxy texture that helps prevent moisture loss. If planted in partial shade, the interior leaves may take on a beautiful "plum" or "dusky violet" tone.
- **Autumn Finale**: As November approaches, the burgundy transitions into a brilliant, translucent scarlet. It is often one of the last maples to change, acting as the "closing act" for the autumn show.
- **Winter Silhouette**: The branching pattern of 'Crimson Queen' is naturally "zig-zag" and intricate. Without its leaves, it resembles a piece of dark, water-worn driftwood. Its low, spreading habit makes it a perfect catch for light frost or dusting snow.

## 3. Design Use & Companion Planting
### Landscape Role
- **Water Feature Companion**: There is no better tree for the edge of a pond or a dry stream bed. Its weeping branches naturally "reach" for the water, creating a sense of peace and reflection.
- **Focal Groundcover**: Because it rarely exceeds 6 feet in height, it is an excellent choice for the middle of a large garden bed. It provides a "mound" of color that draws the eye without blocking the view of trees behind it.

### Companion Planting & Understory
- **Textural Contrast**: Pair with large-leaved plants for maximum impact. The plate-like leaves of **Bergenia** or the bold textures of **Blue Hostas** (like 'Halcyon') make the 'Crimson Queen's' lacey foliage look even more delicate.
- **Color Juxtaposition**: Surround with silver-foliaged perennials like **Artemisia** or **Stachys byzantina** (Lamb's Ear). The silver-on-red color palette is a staple of high-end landscape design.
- **Structure**: Plant near a large, vertical stone or a basalt column. The soft, weeping foliage cascading over the hard, vertical edge of the stone creates a perfect "Yin and Yang" balance.

## 4. Advanced Horticultural Notes
- **Grafting Heights**: 'Crimson Queen' is often grafted at two different heights. "Low grafts" (near the soil) create the classic mounding look. "High grafts" (top-worked at 3-4 feet) create a "standard" or "umbrella" look. When purchasing, choose the graft height that fits your vertical space requirements.
- **Rootstock Resilience**: It is highly compatible with *Acer palmatum* rootstock, but it prefers a "well-drained but cool" root zone. In hotter regions, a thick mulch of pine bark is essential to protect the delicate graft union from fluctuating temperatures.
- **Nutrient Profile**: Responds exceptionally well to organic kelp-based fertilizers. Avoid chemical "Quick Green" fertilizers, which can cause the leaves to grow too fast, resulting in thin, weak lobes that are prone to wind-shredding.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Variety-Specific Issues
- **The "Crisping" Edge**: While heat-tolerant, 'Crimson Queen' hates hot, drying winds. If the edges of the lacey lobes turn brown and brittle, it is likely "wind burn." Provide a windbreak or move the tree to a more sheltered location.
- **Twig Die-back**: Because 'Crimson Queen' creates such a dense "skirt," the interior of the tree receives almost zero light. Over time, these interior twigs will die. Every 3 years, perform "under-skeleton pruning" (Chapter 11) to clear out the brittle dead wood.
- **Fungal Spots**: In humid climates, the dense foliage can harbor mildew. Improve air circulation by thinning the "skirt" slightly so it doesn't sit directly on the wet ground.

> [!TIP]
> To truly showcase 'Crimson Queen', prune away the lowest 12 inches of branches so the tree "hovers" above the ground. This creates a clean line and allows you to plant small spring bulbs like **Snowdrops** underneath for an early-season surprise.
