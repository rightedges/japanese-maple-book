## Overview
A classic weeping lace-leaf maple. 'Crimson Queen' is prized for its fine, lacy texture and its ability to hold its deep red color throughout the season.

## Care Tips
- **Shelter:** Requires shelter from prevailing winds to protect its delicate foliage.
- **Shade:** Dappled shade is ideal; full afternoon sun in hot regions can cause tip burn.
- **Structure:** Its cascading habit makes it a perfect focal point for rock gardens or near water features.
