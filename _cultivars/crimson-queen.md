## Overview
'Crimson Queen' is the gold standard for mounding, weeping lace-leaf maples. Prized for its exquisitely feathery texture and ability to hold a deep burgundy-red color through the hottest summer days, it bridges the gap between delicate collector plants and reliable garden workhorses.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Leaves unfurl like tiny carmine spiders, creating a soft red fog effect.
- **Summer**: Matures to a rich, velvety burgundy with a waxy texture that prevents moisture loss.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions to a translucent scarlet in late autumn. Bare branches resemble intricate, water-worn driftwood in winter.

## Garden Use & Care
A perfect companion for water features or as a focal groundcover that won't block background views. Pair with silver-foliaged plants like **Artemisia** or bold-leaved **Blue Hostas** for high-impact contrast.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Graft Protection**: Ensure well-drained soil and use pine bark mulch to protect the graft union from temperature swings.
- **Skeleton Pruning**: Every 3 years, perform "under-skeleton pruning" to clear out the brittle, light-starved interior twigs.

> [!TIP]
> Prune away the lowest 12 inches of branches so the tree "hovers" above the ground, creating a clean line for underplanting snowdrops.
