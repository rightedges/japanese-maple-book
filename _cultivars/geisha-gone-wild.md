## Overview
'Geisha Gone Wild' is a spectacular variegated cultivar that lives up to its name with a "wild" display of shifting colors. Arising as a sport of 'Geisha', it was honored as the Maple Tree of the Year in 2021 by the Maple Society of North America. It is prized by collectors for its dramatic multi-colored leaves and graceful, upright habit.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with a stunning explosion of maroon and bright pink. The leaves are often curled, adding a unique texture to the vibrant display.
- **Summer**: The foliage matures to a deep green with irregular margins of cream, white, and occasionally lingering pink.
- **Fall**: Provides a dramatic finale with leaves turning brilliant shades of hot pink, purple, orange, and even bright yellow.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal as a focal point in a small garden, courtyard, or large container. Its compact size and upright, vase-shaped habit make it versatile for tight spaces where a splash of seasonal color is needed.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Protection**: To maintain the best variegation and prevent leaf scorch, provide morning sun and afternoon shade. In cooler climates, it can tolerate more sun if kept well-watered.
- **Soil Health**: Prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil. Use an organic mulch to keep the root zone cool and moist.
- **Minimal Pruning**: Naturally grows into a pleasing shape, so only structural pruning or removal of dead wood is typically required.

> [!TIP]
> 'Geisha Gone Wild' is best planted where its intricate leaf patterns can be appreciated up close, such as near a patio or along a primary garden path.
