## Overview
'Murasaki Kiyohime' ("Purple Princess") is a vigorous dwarf maple known for its low, mounding spread and tiny, purple-edged leaves. Typically growing wider than it is tall (2-6ft), it creates a luxurious "carpet" of green and purple that is exceptionally durable compared to more delicate dwarfs.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring Flush**: Small, bright green leaves emerge with striking deep purple-red edges and tips, providing a refined, "dipped" appearance.
- **Summer Stability**: Matures to a glossy dark green, often retaining subtle hints of its purple margins. Its dense, twiggy habit provides excellent coverage.
- **Fall Finish**: Transitions through bright bronze-yellows to rich oranges. New growth in autumn often repeats the purple-tipped spring effect.

## Garden Use & Care
A premier choice for planting at the base of larger trees, in rock gardens, or as a low-maintenance container specimen. Its strength and small leaf size make it the #1 choice for "shohin" (miniature) bonsai.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Air Circulation**: Because of its dense, ground-hugging habit, ensure it’s not smothered by heavy mulch; leave a 2-inch gap around the main stems to prevent rot.
- **Structural Pruning**: Every few years, thin out the interior twigs to reveal the delicate, multi-stemmed structure beneath the "princess" canopy.

> [!TIP]
> Plant along a stone walkway where the low, mounding habit can soften the hard edges of the masonry and guests can appreciate the tiny, purple-tipped leaves.
