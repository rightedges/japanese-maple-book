## Overview
'Bihou', heavily popularized as a golden companion to the red-barked 'Sango Kaku', offers a stunning winter display. Its stems range from butter-yellow to apricot-orange, creating a vivid contrast in the dormant garden. While spectacular, it is known for being somewhat more temperamental than other bark-interest maples.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Leaves emerge a pleasant chartreuse-green, often with flushed orange tips, maturing to a light green in summer.
- **Fall & Winter**: Fall color is a reliable yellow-gold. The true show begins after leaf drop, when the bark glows with intense yellow and orange hues.
- **Bark Care**: Like other bark maples, the color is best on young wood. Regular pruning encourages new, vibrant stems.

## Garden Use & Care
Excellent for winter interest, especially when planted alongside red-barked maples or dark evergreens. It serves as a bright focal point in the dreary months.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Fungal Sensitivity**: 'Bihou' has a reputation for being susceptible to stem dieback (Pseudomonas/Anthracnose), especially in wet climates.
- **Microclimate**: Plant in a location with excellent air circulation and perfect drainage. Avoid heavy, wet soils at all costs.
- **Protection**: In colder zones, protect from harsh drying winds which can desiccate the stems.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to its susceptibility to dieback, ensure sanitation when pruning. Sterilize tools between cuts and avoid overhead watering that keeps stems wet for prolonged periods.
