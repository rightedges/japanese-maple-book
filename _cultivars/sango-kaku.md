## Overview
Famous for its coral-red winter bark, 'Sango Kaku' provides year-round interest. The bright green summer leaves turn a brilliant gold in autumn, contrasting beautifully with the stems.

## Care Tips
- **Bark Color:** The red bark color is most intense on young wood and requires adequate sunlight to develop fully.
- **Sensitivity:** The foliage is sensitive to hot afternoon sun and dry winds, which can cause leaf scorch.
- **Pruning:** Minimal pruning is needed, but thinning can help display the colorful structural branches.
