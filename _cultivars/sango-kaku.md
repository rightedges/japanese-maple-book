## Overview
'Sango Kaku', or the "Coral Bark Maple," is primarily celebrated for its vibrant neon coral-pink winter bark. A member of the vigorous **Matsumurae** group, it provides a dramatic, year-round color shift, culminating in a hypnotic display against the grey winter landscape.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Chartreuse leaves with reddish margins emerge, maturing into a bright, glossy green with an airy canopy.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions through apricot-gold to a complete bareness that triggers the fluorescent coral-red bark intensification.
- **Bark Care**: The intense color is most prominent on 1-2 year old growth ("twigs"). Proper pruning is essential to encourage the regular production of this juvenile wood.

## Garden Use & Care
An ideal "window specimen" near kitchens or living rooms to brighten winter views. Pair with yellow-barked **Dogwoods** for a high-impact "fire and ice" effect.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Avoid Winter Pruning**: To prevent **Bacterial Blight** (twig blackening), wait until the dry heat of mid-summer to make cuts.
- **Drainage**: Requires perfect drainage; heavy, water-logged clay can cause rapid die-back.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. "Fast" growth is "soft" growth, which is significantly more vulnerable to winter kill and bacterial infection.
