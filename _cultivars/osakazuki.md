## Overview
'Osakazuki' is the world’s finest autumn-display maple, known for its incandescent scarlet transition that lasts for weeks. Belonging to the rugged **Amoenum** group, it features large, slightly concave leaves ("Wine Cups") and a vigorous, tree-like growth habit that is exceptionally resilient for novice gardeners.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Understated dusty bronze-green emergence matures into a deep, glossy forest green. Thick leaf cuticles provide superior resistance to sun and wind "tip burn."
- **Autumn**: Transforms into a searing, fluorescent scarlet wall of fire. This intense display is triggered by sunlight, requiring at least 5-6 hours of exposure for the full effect.
- **Winter**: Forms a powerful architectural presence with a strong, thick trunk and a broad rounded crown.

## Garden Use & Care
An ideal property anchor or privacy screen due to its 20-25 foot height. Pair with golden **Ginkgo biloba** for the ultimate autumn color combination.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Thinning cuts**: Use winter thinning cuts to manage its vigorous, "whip-like" branches and maintain a tidy rounded crown.
- **Drought Protection**: Due to its large leaf surface area, it requires deep weekly soaking during dry periods to prevent stress.

> [!TIP]
> Plant in a loose triangle with 15-foot spacing to create a massive, unified fire-red canopy as the trees mature.
