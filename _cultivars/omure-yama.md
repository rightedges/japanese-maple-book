## Overview
'Omure yama' is arguably the most dramatic of the Matsumurae group, often called the "Willow Style" Japanese Maple. While it grows upright, its branches are long, slender, and pendulous, cascading nearly to the ground. In autumn, it transforms into a burning fountain of gold and crimson.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Form**: True weeping habit on an upright trunk. It flows like water.
- **Foliage**: Deeply divided, star-shaped leaves that are elegant and refined.
- **Fall**: Spectacular. The leaves turn a vivid orange-gold to crimson, glowing intensely before dropping.

## Garden Use & Care
Use as a large specimen plant where its structural "fountain" shape can be admired. It looks stunning near water features.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Staking**: Young trees may need staking to establish a high enough trunk before they start their weeping cascade.
- **Color Turnover**: One of the latest to turn color in fall, extending the season into November.
