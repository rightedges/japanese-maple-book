## Overview
'Sekka Yatsubusa' is a unique cultivar defined by its tufted leaf arrangement and occasional "fasciation" (flattened stems with congested growth). Growing into a dense, upright tree (10-12ft), it offers a fascinating architectural texture that becomes more pronounced and "sculptural" as the tree ages.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring Emergence**: Narrow-lobed leaves emerge light green to chartreuse, often highlighted with rust-colored or red-orange margins.
- **Summer Display**: Matures into a glossy, healthy dark green. The layered, tufted growth creates internal "pads" of foliage that give the tree an ancient, structured look.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions through vibrant shades of yellow and orange to deep red. Winter reveals the unique flattened stems and dense, twiggy structure.

## Garden Use & Care
An exceptional choice for enthusiasts looking for a "conversation piece." Its adaptable nature allows it to handle full sun or heavy shade, making it a versitile specimen for small-to-mid size gardens or as a high-impact container tree.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Stem Health**: The dense, fasciated growth can sometimes trap debris; perform light internal cleaning in winter to maintain air circulation.
- **Bonsai Potential**: Due to its naturally congested growth and layered leaves, it is one of the premier cultivars for large-scale bonsai training.

> [!TIP]
> To emphasize the tree's unique bark and fasciated stems, use uplighting at night to cast dramatic shadows through the layered canopy.
