## Overview
'Deshojo' is legendary in the bonsai world for one reason: its spring color. The new leaves emerge a shocking, impossible shade of carmine-red, looking almost like painted flowers. While it fades to green in summer, that spring opening is considered one of the finest spectacles in the Acer genus.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Brilliant, fluorescent red.
- **Summer**: Fades to a neutral green/blue-green.
- **Fall**: Turns a modest orange-red.
- **Habit**: Naturally twiggy and compact, making it perfect for container culture.

## Garden Use & Care
Primarily grown for spring interest. It is a staple of any serious maple collection and the #1 choice for "Spring Color" bonsai.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Pruning**: Responds exceptionally well to heavy pruning and root work, which is why it is so beloved by bonsai artists.
- **Sun**: Needs protection from the hottest afternoon sun to prolong the spring show.
