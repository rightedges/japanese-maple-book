## Overview
'Hime-shojo' is a stunning dwarf cultivar prized for its intense cherry-red foliage and compact, shrubby habit. Unlike many red maples that fade to bronze in summer, this "little girl" maintains a vibrant maroon-red through the heat, consistently pushing new bright-red growth flushes.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring Emergence**: Leaves unfurl in a shocking, brilliant cherry red that lights up the spring garden.
- **Summer Display**: Matures to a deep maroon but remains remarkably stable. New growth provides a constant splash of brighter red over the older foliage.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions back to a fire-engine cherry red peak. Its dwarf, densely-branched habit provides a tidy structural presence in winter.

## Garden Use & Care
An elite choice for containers, rock gardens, or as a small-scale focal point (3-6ft). Its compact size and frequent growth flushes make it a premier candidate for bonsai enthusiasts.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Afternoon Shade**: Provide protection from the harsh 2 PM - 5 PM sun in hotter climates to prevent the delicate leaf tips from scorching.
- **Tidy Structure**: Requires very little pruning; its naturally globe-shaped habit is self-maintaining.

> [!TIP]
> Plant in a light-colored ceramic pot to maximize the visual pop of its cherry-red spring foliage.
