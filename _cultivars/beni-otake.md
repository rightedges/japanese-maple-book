## Overview
'Beni otake' means "Red Bamboo," referring to its long, strap-like lobes that resemble bamboo leaves. It is one of the most substantial and vigorous of the Linearilobum group. Unlike the delicate 'Koto no ito', 'Beni otake' has a strong, bold presence with foliage that holds its color well in heat.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Foliage**: Long, narrow lobes that flutter gracefully in the breeze.
- **Color**: Emerges bright red, maturing to a deep maroon-red in summer.
- **Fall**: Turns a brilliant crimson.
- **Resilience**: Unlike many strap-leaf varieties, it rarely burns in full sun once established.

## Garden Use & Care
Excellent for adding texture to a sunny border. Its vertical habit and unique leaf shape provide a distinct contrast to the typical palmate leaves of 'Bloodgood' or 'Emperor 1'.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Vigor**: Grows faster than most "bamboo-leaf" maples.
- **Structure**: Tends to be very upright; may need early training to encourage branching if a wider canopy is desired.
