## Overview
'Autumn Moon' is a spectacular Shirasawanum cultivar that offers a more durable alternative to the classic 'Aureum'. While 'Aureum' is pure gold, 'Autumn Moon' features a unique "peach" or burned-orange blush over its chartreuse leaves. It is generally considered more sun-tolerant and vigorous than its golden cousin.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with a strong pink-orange flush over lime green.
- **Summer**: In moderate sun, it develops a beautiful peach-gold cast. In deep shade, it stays chartreuse.
- **Fall**: A brilliant show of electric orange and scarlet.
- **Form**: Creates a dense, bushy, upright mound with tiered branching.

## Garden Use & Care
Perfect for a spot with morning sun and afternoon shade. The morning sun is necessary to develop the "peach" tones in the foliage. It pairs beautifully with purple-leaved cultivars like 'Bloodgood'.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun/Color Relationship**: If planted in too much shade, it will look like a standard green maple. If in too much sun, the leaf margins may scorch. Finding the "Gouldilocks" zone of dappled light is key.
- **Growth Rate**: Moderate; faster than 'Aureum' but slower than most Palmatums.
