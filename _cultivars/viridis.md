## Overview
'Viridis' is the quintessential green weeping lace-leaf maple. Known for its elegant, cascading habit and finely dissected foliage, it creates a soft, mounding presence in any garden setting.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with bright, almost lime-green leaves that are deeply cut and delicate.
- **Summer**: Matures to a rich emerald green that provides a cooling texture in the landscape.
- **Fall**: One of the best for yellow and gold fall color, often finishing with touches of orange.

## Garden Use & Care
Perfect for rock gardens, pond edges, or as a focal point in a small bed. Its weeping form is naturally artistic and requires little training.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Airflow**: Because of its dense mounding habit, thin out some of the interior branches occasionally to allow for better air circulation.
- **Shelter**: Like most dissectums, it appreciates protection from strong, drying winds.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Viridis' is a slow grower that eventually forms a wide, beautiful dome, making it a lifetime investment for the garden.
