## Overview
'Seiryu' ("Blue Dragon") is a botanical marvel: the only widely available upright lace-leaf maple. It combines the delicate, feathery foliage of the **Dissectum** group with the vigorous, vase-like habit of **Palmatums**, offering lacey texture without the weeping footprint.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Bright chartreuse ribbons emerge with pinkish-bronze tips, maturing into a crisp emerald emerald green that moves like a "flurry of feathers."
- **Fall & Winter**: Legendary patchwork show of gold, orange, and deep red. Winter reveals a strong "V" architectural element, ideal for narrow spaces.
- **Resilience**: Highly heat-tolerant with a surprisingly high limit for transpiration, making it ideal for sun-baked suburban yards.

## Garden Use & Care
Perfect for narrow side-yards or creating sheltered seating areas with a high, "feathery" screen. Its vertical dominance allows for underplanting with **Japanese Forest Grass** or **Bleeding Hearts**.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Internal Thinning**: Prune out small, crossing twigs inside the "V" to allow light and air to reach the interior and prevent die-back.
- **Reaction Wood**: Avoid staking too tightly; allowing the trunk to move in the wind builds a stronger, more stable tree.

> [!TIP]
> 'Seiryu' is a premier candidate for **Niwaki** (cloud pruning), where its vigor allows you to create large "pads" of lacey foliage that look like floating green clouds.
