## Overview
A rare upright-growing lace-leaf maple. 'Seiryu' offers the delicate "dissected" foliage usually found on weeping trees but on a strong, upright-branching specimen.

## Care Tips
- **Vigor:** Much more vigorous and heat-tolerant than most weeping lace-leaf varieties.
- **Fall Color:** Can show a beautiful range of gold, orange, and red simultaneously in autumn.
- **Pruning:** Responds well to structural pruning to emphasize its elegant vase shape.
