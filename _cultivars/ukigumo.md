## Overview
'Ukigumo' ("Floating Cloud") is the holy grail of variegated maples, known for its ethereal, snow-like appearance. Its leaves are so heavily flecked with white and soft pink that the tree appears as a "spectral ghost" or a floating cloud in the shaded garden corners.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: A shocking initial flush of white, cream, and baby-pink with almost no green, creating a translucent "halo" effect.
- **Summer**: Chlorophyll "mottling" or freckles appear as the tree sustains itself, maintaining a striking contrast against the green landscape.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions into a sophisticated "pink haze" or peach glow. Winter reveals a smooth grey-green bark and a quiet, upright vertical presence.

## Garden Use & Care
The ultimate shadow-beacon for lighting up dark garden corners. **It must be planted against a dark solid background** (like Yew or a dark fence) to make the white leaves visible. Pair with **Black Mondo Grass** for a high-design Zen look.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Variegation Variability**: Variegation can be "moody" and may diminish with excessive nitrogen; do not use high-nitrogen fertilizers like "Miracle-Gro."
- **Reversion Protection**: Prune out any solid green branches immediately to prevent them from out-competing the variegated portions.

> [!CAUTION]
> White leaves have **zero UV protection**. Deep, dappled shade is a non-negotiable requirement to prevent brown, oxidation-induced papery crisping within hours.
