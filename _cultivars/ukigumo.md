## Overview
One of the most ethereal and sought-after variegated maples. 'Ukigumo' features leaves that are almost entirely white, speckled with small dots of green, giving the tree a misty or "floating" appearance from a distance.

## Care Tips
- **Shade Critical:** Requires deep, dappled shade. The white portions of the leaves lack chlorophyll and will burn instantly in direct afternoon sun.
- **Watering:** Consistent moisture is key to preventing leaf stress, as the variegated foliage is naturally fragile.
- **Siting:** Best planted against a dark background (like a dark fence or deep green evergreens) to make the white foliage pop.
