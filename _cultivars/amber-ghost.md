## Overview
'Amber Ghost' is a standout in the "Ghost" series, featuring rich amber and coral tones in the spring that contrast sharply with deep green veins. It offers a warmth that is unique among reticulated variegated maples.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Stunning emergence of amber, coral, and pink leaves with a network of dark green veins.
- **Summer**: Slowly transitions to a soft green with subtle amber undertones. 
- **Fall**: Spectacular finish in bright golds, oranges, and often fiery reds.

## Garden Use & Care
Adds a warm, glowing quality to shaded areas. Like its siblings, it requires protection from the sun to maintain its delicate coloration.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Afternoon Shade**: Critical for protecting the unique spring colors from fading or burning.
- **Moisture**: Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged.

> [!TIP]
> Plant 'Amber Ghost' near dark-foliaged plants or in a dark corner to see it "glow" in the shade.
