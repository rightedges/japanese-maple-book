## Overview
'Moonrise' is a spectacular *Acer shirasawanum* hybrid that offers the beauty of the "Full Moon" maple with significantly improved resilience. It is famous for its glowing chartreuse spring leaves that emerge with a distinct orange-red blush.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: New growth emerges bright orange-pink, slowly transitioning to a radiant neon green.
- **Summer**: Maintains a cool chartreuse color that is much more resistant to leaf burn than the traditional 'Aureum'.
- **Fall**: A dramatic shift to intense oranges and golds, often with scarlet highlights.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal as a mid-sized focal point in partially shaded areas. Its luminous foliage can "light up" a dark corner of the garden.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Afternoon Shade**: While more sun-tolerant than other Shirasawanums, it still benefits from protection during the hottest hours of the day in warmer climates.
- **Watering**: Ensure consistent moisture, especially during the first two years after planting.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Moonrise' is often considered the best choice for gardeners who love the look of the Golden Full Moon maple but struggle with leaf scorch.
