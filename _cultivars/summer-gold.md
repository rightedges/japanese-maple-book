## Overview
'Summer Gold' is a horticultural breakthrough: a yellow-leaved maple that thrives in full sun. Unlike older varieties that burn in mid-July, this "solar-powered" masterpiece maintains its brilliant lemon-yellow color even in 90°F heat, bringing a permanent, high-luminosity glow to sunny landscapes.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges as an "illuminated" beacon of translucent lemon-yellow with subtle orange tips.
- **Summer**: Its true glory—it stays yellow when others turn green to defend against UV rays, hardening into a vibrant, waxy gold that provides a permanent "spotlight" effect.
- **Fall**: Transitions to a rich cadmium-yellow or bright orange, often holding its leaves longer than delicate shade maples.

## Garden Use & Care
The #1 choice for a sunny mixed border. For maximum impact, plant in front of a **Dark Evergreen Hedge** to create a professional yellow-on-dark-green contrast.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Moisture Shield**: While sun-tolerant, it requires consistent moisture to maintain its UV "shield." Mulch with pine bark to keep roots cool in Zones 8-9.
- **Soil Drainage**: Sensitive to "wet feet"; if planting in heavy clay, use a raised mound to protect the root crown from black spots and leaf drop.

> [!TIP]
> Planting a 'Summer Gold' is the horticultural equivalent of turning on a 500-watt light bulb that never burns out in a "dark" corner of your sunny garden.
