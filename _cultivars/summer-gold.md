## Overview
As the name suggests, 'Summer Gold' is a rare yellow-leaved variety that actually thrives in the summer sun. While most yellow maples scorch easily, 'Summer Gold' retains its vibrant golden-yellow color through July and August.

## Care Tips
- **Sun Strategy:** Unlike many of its cousins, this tree *wants* sun. In too much shade, the color will fade to a light green.
- **Fall Shift:** The golden summer leaves turn a rich, buttery gold in the fall.
- **Habit:** Grows into a compact, upright vase shape, making it excellent for smaller garden spaces.
