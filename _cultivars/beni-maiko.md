## Overview
Prized for its brilliant fire-red spring foliage. The name means "Red Haired Dancing Girl," referring to the way the small, delicate leaves move and glow in the spring sun.

## Care Tips
- **Frost Protection:** One of the earliest to leaf out. Protect from late spring frosts which can damage the delicate first flush.
- **Summer Shift:** Leaves often fade to a reddish-green in mid-summer before turning scarlet again in the fall.
- **Size:** Stays naturally compact and bushy, making it great for smaller gardens.
