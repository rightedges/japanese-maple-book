## Overview
'Beni maiko' is a small, bushy "semi-dwarf" known for its intense, neon carmine-red spring flush. Its name, "The Red-Haired Dancing Girl," perfectly captures its flamboyant and constantly changing seasonal personality.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Features the most intense, fluorescent carmine-red flush of any Palmatum.
- **Summer**: The centers turn olive green while veins and edges keep a reddish-pink glow, creating a unique bicolored effect.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions to a solid, deep scarlet mound in autumn, followed by fine, grey-and-red twiggy structure in winter.

## Garden Use & Care
Excellent for containers or the front of a garden border due to its compact 6-8 foot height. Best with morning sun and afternoon shade in hot climates to prevent leaf burn.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Frost Protection**: Cover with frost cloth during late spring freezes, as the early neon buds are extremely tender.
- **Mite Control**: Blast the interior with water during hot summers to prevent spider mites in the dense twiggy growth.

> [!TIP]
> Plant in a dark charcoal or black pot to make the neon spring foliage and scarlet autumn colors truly "pop."
