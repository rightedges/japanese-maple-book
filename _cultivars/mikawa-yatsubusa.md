## Overview
'Mikawa Yatsubusa' is the crown jewel of dwarf maples, often described as a "living sculpture." Its defining trait is its extremely short internodes, causing leaves to overlap like shingles or dragon scales, creating an ancient, gnarled appearance even in young saplings.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Densely packed clusters of neon chartreuse emerge, creating explosions of green light that gradually develop bronze tips.
- **Summer**: Settles into a forest green "shingled" canopy that is remarkably efficient at shading its own interior.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions to glowing gold and fiery orange. Once bare, its intricate, knobby branch structure provides a stunning winter silhouette.

## Garden Use & Care
Place at eye-level near entrances or in ornamental pots to appreciate its sculptural detail. Pair with minimalist companions like **Black Mondo Grass** or **Irish Moss** to allow the complex tree structure to stand out.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Interior Cleaning**: Snap off small, brittle dead twigs from the light-starved center once a year to maintain air circulation.
- **Pest Monitoring**: Overlapping leaves are natural refuges for aphids; use a sharp water blast to dislodge them from tight clumps.

> [!CAUTION]
> As a slow-growing sculptural masterpiece, major pruning mistakes can take 5-10 years to fill in. Always "measure twice, cut once."
