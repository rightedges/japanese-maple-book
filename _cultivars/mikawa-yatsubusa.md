## Overview
A collector's favorite, 'Mikawa Yatsubusa' is a unique dwarf variety with closely spaced, shingled leaves that look like green scales or shingles on a roof.

## Care Tips
- **Growth Rate:** Extremely slow-growing. Do not over-fertilize in an attempt to speed it up, as this can ruin its tight habit.
- **Container Culture:** An ideal candidate for long-term container growth or bonsai.
- **Siting:** Perfect for rock gardens or as a small-scale focal point where its unique texture can be appreciated up close.
