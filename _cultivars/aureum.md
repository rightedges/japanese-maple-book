## Overview
Often called the "Golden Full Moon Maple," 'Aureum' is perhaps the most famous yellow-leaved maple in the world. Its rounded, fan-like leaves are a luminous, translucent chartreuse-gold. In a shaded garden, it glows as if lit from within, brightening the darkest corners.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Leaves unfold in soft pleats of pale yellow with orange margins.
- **Summer**: Matures to a glowing chartreuse-gold.
- **Fall**: A spectacular blend of orange and red, often with purple tones.
- **Form**: Slow-growing and sturdy, forming a wide, architectural canopy.

## Garden Use & Care
The ultimate focal point for a shade garden. It pairs perfectly with blue hostas and dark green ferns.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Protection**: This is a true shade lover. Direct afternoon sun will scorch the leaves instantly. Morning sun or high dappled shade is ideal.
- **Patience**: It is a very slow grower, often taking 15+ years to reach mature size.
- **Hardiness**: Surprisingly cold hardy (Zone 5), but sensitive to late spring frosts.
