## Overview
A classic from the *Linearilobum* group, often called the "Willow-leaf Maple" due to its extremely long and narrow leaf lobes. It provides a light, airy, and movement-filled texture in the landscape.

## Care Tips
- **Airy Texture:** Its sparse canopy provides an excellent light filter for understory plants.
- **Wind:** Moves beautifully in a light breeze, but can be susceptible to leaf-burn in very strong, dry winds.
- **Pruning:** Structure pruning helps emphasize the long, thin branches that carry the unique foliage.
