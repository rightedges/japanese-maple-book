## Overview
'Scolopendrifolium' is an elegant **Linearilobum** maple defined by its long, ribbon-like lobes that resemble willow fronds. It creates a "transparent," airy canopy that moves gracefully in the wind, providing filtered light and a unique "audible" experience for Zen gardens and minimalist spaces.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Emerges as bundles of soft, pea-green ribbons that mature into deep emerald. The narrow lobes create a kinetic "willow" effect in the slightest breeze.
- **Fall & Winter**: Transitions into a luminous golden-yellow that lasts for weeks. Winter reveals a fine, twiggy structure that provides a delicate vertical screen.
- **Horticultural Advantage**: The narrow lobes have almost no "mesophyll," making them significantly more resistant to fungal issues like powdery mildew.

## Garden Use & Care
The #1 choice for underplanting, as its airy canopy allows 60-70% of light to reach shade-loving perennials. Pair with bold architectural plants like **Siberian Iris** for textural contrast.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Wind Protection**: Ribbon-like leaves are prone to drying out in extreme hot winds; place in an eye-level, sheltered location for the best experience.
- **Renewal Thinning**: Every 3 years, remove 20% of the oldest stems from the base to maintain the tree’s "airy" and youthful look.

> [!TIP]
> Plant near a patio to enjoy one of the most relaxing "natural white noises" in the garden: the gentle rustle of the wind through the willow-leaves.
