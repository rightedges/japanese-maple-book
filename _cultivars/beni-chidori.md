## Overview
'Beni Chidori', translating to "Red Plover" (a type of shorebird), is a stunning dwarf variety often compared to 'Beni maiko' but distinct in its growth habit and subtle color variations. It is prized for its spectacular spring display of shrimp-pink to orange-red foliage that seems to glow in the garden.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with brilliant shrimp-pink to crimson-orange leaves. The color is incredibly vivid and lasts for several weeks.
- **Summer**: The foliage matures to a bronze-green or completely green, often retaining red tones on new growth or tips.
- **Fall**: Transforms into a mix of golds and oranges, providing a warm autumn display.

## Garden Use & Care
Its compact, shrub-like habit makes 'Beni Chidori' an excellent choice for smaller gardens, courtyards, or containers. It works closely well as a foreground plant in a layered border.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Pruning**: Requires minimal pruning. Remove dead or crossing branches in late winter.
- **Sun/Partial Shade**: While it tolerates sun, protection from the harsh midday sun in hotter climates will prolong the intensity of the spring color and prevent leaf scorch.
- **Soil**: Thrives in moist, well-draining, slightly acidic soil.
