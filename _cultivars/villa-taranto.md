## Overview
'Villa Taranto' is one of the most refined cultivars in the Linearilobum group. Its extremely narrow, willow-like lobes give it an airy, transparent quality that is highly sought after by collectors.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges with a strong reddish-pink tint on the narrow leaves.
- **Summer**: The color transitions to a soft green with reddish tips, maintaining a delicate "spider-like" texture.
- **Fall**: Turns a beautiful, luminous golden yellow.

## Garden Use & Care
Its semi-dwarf, vase-shaped habit makes it ideal for smaller gardens or as a specimen in a mixed border where its transparency can be appreciated.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Tolerance**: Surprisingly sun-tolerant for such a fine-textured tree, though it appreciates some break from the harshest afternoon sun.
- **Minimal Pruning**: Naturally maintains a graceful shape; only prune to remove dead wood or occasional crossing branches.

> [!TIP]
> Use 'Villa Taranto' to create "layers" in your garden; you can see through its airy canopy to plants positioned behind it.
