## Overview
'Sensu' is a sophisticated cultivar whose name translates to "moving fan," perfectly capturing the graceful, pendulous movement of its foliage in a light breeze. While often grouped with *Acer palmatum*, it is technically an *Acer shirasawanum* hybrid, inheriting the superior hardiness and luminous leaf quality of the Full Moon maple lineage.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: New growth emerges in a delicate palette of salmon pink and light green, often with orange-red highlights on the leaf margins.
- **Summer**: The foliage matures into a crisp medium green, frequently retaining a red or pinkish "blush" that adds a layer of depth to the canopy.
- **Fall**: Renowned for its dramatic finale, 'Sensu' transforms into a magnificent display of coppery orange, scarlet, and flaming crimson.

## Garden Use & Care
With its upright yet compact habit reaching 8-12 feet, 'Sensu' is an ideal focal point for smaller urban gardens or as a specimen in a mixed border. Its architectural form and "moving" foliage provide a dynamic element that pairs beautifully with static evergreens.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Wind Protection**: To fully appreciate the "fan" movement without damage, site 'Sensu' in an area protected from harsh, drying winds.
- **Light Balance**: While more sun-tolerant than the golden 'Aureum', 'Sensu' appreciates dappled afternoon shade in hotter climates (Zones 8-9) to prevent leaf scorch.
- **Pruning**: Requires very little structural pruning; focus on removing crossing branches to keep the interior open and airy.

> [!TIP]
> Plant 'Sensu' where it can be viewed against a darker background to maximize the visual impact of its shifting seasonal colors and delicate texture.
