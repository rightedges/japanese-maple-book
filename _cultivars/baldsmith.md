## Overview
'Baldsmith' is a unique weeping dissectum known for its complex, shifting color palette. Forming a cascading dome (4-6ft), it offers a rare multi-colored effect where spring's coral-red hues transition into a light green-and-pink summer tapestry.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring Flush**: Finely dissected leaves emerge a vibrant coral pink to bright orange-red, creating a striking early-season display.
- **Summer Tapestry**: Matures to a soft light green with prominent pink or red margins, giving the tree a constantly shifting, multi-colored appearance.
- **Fall Transition**: Turns brilliant shades of yellow, orange, and red, often displaying all three colors simultaneously on the same branch.

## Garden Use & Care
A perfect focal point for rock gardens or as a specimen near a pond where its cascading form can be appreciated. Its dome-shaped habit makes it ideal for large, wide containers.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Consistent Moisture**: Like most dissectums, it requires consistently moist, well-drained soil; don't let the root ball dry out completely in summer.
- **Internal Pruning**: Clean out small dead interior twigs in winter to maintain the health of the cascading "skirt."

> [!TIP]
> Plant 'Baldsmith' where you can view it from above, such as near a deck or a retaining wall, to fully appreciate its weeping structure and color shifts.
