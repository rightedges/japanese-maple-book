## Overview
'Baton Rouge' is a mid-sized coral bark maple (10-15ft) specifically bred for extreme heat and humidity tolerance. While similar to 'Sango Kaku', 'Baton Rouge' is famed for its even more intense "lipstick-red" winter bark and its ability to thrive in full sun in southern climates.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Emerging green with occasional red tipping, the leaves settle into a soft, cooling green. The tree maintains a vigorous, upright vase shape throughout the growing season.
- **Fall Finale**: Foliage turns a bright, clean yellow with occasional red and orange flashes as the weather cools.
- **Winter Peak**: Once the leaves drop, the young stems glow with a searing, fluorescent red that is often considered the brightest in the coral bark group.

## Garden Use & Care
An essential choice for southern landscapes (Zones 7-9) where other coral bark maples might struggle with heat stress. Excellent as a winter specimen against grey skies or as a high-contrast companion for winter-blooming shrubs.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun Strategy**: To get the brightest winter bark, plant in full sun. The intense UV exposure "tans" the bark into that legendary lipstick-red.
- **Drainage First**: Despite its heat tolerance, it still requires well-drained soil; wet, soggy roots will lead to twig die-back and reduced bark color.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To keep the red color vibrant, prune the oldest wood every 3-4 years to encourage a flush of new "fire-stick" growth, which holds the most intense pigment.
