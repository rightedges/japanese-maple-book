## Overview
'Koto no ito' lives up to its name, which translates to "Harp Strings." It features some of the finest, most thread-like foliage of any Acer palmatum. The leaves emerge broadly in spring but thin out to delicate filaments in summer, creating an incredibly soft, bamboo-like texture.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: New growth is a light green with crimson tones on the leaf tips. The lobes are slightly broader at this stage.
- **Summer**: Foliage matures to a deep, reliable green. The lobes narrow significantly, resembling fine strings.
- **Fall**: A spectacular display of golden-yellow mixed with apricot-orange.
- **Form**: Develops a graceful, upright vase shape that widens with age.

## Garden Use & Care
A perfect choice for small courtyards, Asian-themed gardens, or containers where its subtle texture can be viewed up close. It contrasts beautifully with broad-leaved hostas or dark evergreens.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Sun/Shade**: Prefers morning sun and afternoon shade. While reasonably heat tolerant, the fine leaves can scorch in harsh, hot winds.
- **Pruning**: Requires very little pruning. Remove any strong, reverting branches that have broad leaves to maintain the "harp string" character.

> [!TIP]
> This cultivar is renowned for its changing leaf shape. Don't be alarmed if spring leaves look different from summer leaves; this dimorphism is part of its charm.
