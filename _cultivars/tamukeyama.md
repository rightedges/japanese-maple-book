## Overview
'Tamukeyama' is the ultimate "no-excuses" red weeping maple, legendary for its 300-year history and incredible resilience. It handles heat, humidity, and wind better than almost any other dissectum, making it the #1 choice for challenging sunny spots in USDA Zones 7-9.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring & Summer**: Emerge as deep crimson-purple with "leathery" leaves that resist scorching. It maintains a dark maroon-red even in 100°F (38°C) August heat.
- **Autumn**: Transitions to a shocking scarlet, often as the "final fire" of the season.
- **Form**: A powerful, arching "mushroom" habit with thick, sturdy structural branches.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideally suited for sunny slopes or as a reliable courtyard focal point. Pair with gold-leaved plants like **Aureum Dogwood** or structural companions like **Blue Star Juniper**.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Skirt Lifting**: Prune the lower branches every 2-3 years to keep them 6 inches above the mulch, preventing "bottom-heavy" growth and fungal issues.
- **Root Management**: Tease out roots thoroughly when planting to prevent late-stage root girdling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain the iconic "weeping" look, do not allow branches to rest on the ground. Proper air flow around the trunk is essential for long-term health.
