## Overview
The gold standard for red weeping lace-leaf maples in hot climates. 'Tamukeyama' is famous for its exceptional heat and soil tolerance, making it the preferred choice for gardeners in the American South.

## Care Tips
- **Heat Hero:** If you have a sunny spot and want a red dissectum, this is your best bet. It holds its purple-red color better than almost any other weeping variety in high heat.
- **Fall Glow:** Turns a brilliant, glowing scarlet in the fall.
- **Branching:** Has a naturally beautiful cascading habit that looks stunning even in the winter when bare.
