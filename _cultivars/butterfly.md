## Overview
Perhaps the most resilient and reliable of the variegated Japanese Maples. 'Butterfly' features small, grayish-green leaves with erratic white margins that often take on pink highlights in the spring and red tones in the fall.

## Care Tips
- **Resilience:** Much more hardy and sun-tolerant than 'Ukigumo'. It can handle mild morning sun without scorching.
- **Reversion:** Occasionally, a branch may produce solid green leaves. Prune these "reversions" out immediately to maintain the variegated look.
- **Form:** Naturally grows into a multi-stemmed, shrubby upright tree.
