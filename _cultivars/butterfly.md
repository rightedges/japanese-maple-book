## Overview
'Butterfly' is the most reliable variegated maple for the average gardener. It features small, elegant leaves with irregular creamy-white margins that wrap around a soft green center, providing a shimmering "fly-away" texture that handles environmental stress better than more delicate variegated relatives.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges as a cloud of neon pink, with margined magenta edges that eventually recede to white.
- **Summer**: Transitions to a crisp cream-on-emerald palette. The cup-shaped leaves create a multifaceted shimmering effect in the wind.
- **Fall**: White margins turn a saturated magenta or "painted" red, creating a unique, brushed-on glow.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal as a patio pillar or a soft privacy screen. Its slow growth and 8-12 foot maturity make it a top container choice. Pair with **Black Mondo Grass** or dark-leaved **Heucheras** for maximum contrast.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Reversion Monitoring**: Prune out any solid green branches immediately to maintain the variegated genetics.
- **Shearing**: Responds well to light "cloud pruning" or hedging in late summer to encourage a thicker, more "butterfly-like" habit.

> [!TIP]
> Morning sun and afternoon shade is the secret to keeping 'Butterfly' leaf margins pristine and preventing tip scorch in hotter zones.
