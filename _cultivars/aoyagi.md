## Overview
'Aoyagi' (meaning "Green Willow") is the green counterpart to the famous red-barked 'Sango Kaku'. It is prized for its bright pea-green bark, which provides stunning architectural interest in the winter landscape.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Soft, bright green leaves emerge, creating a fresh, lush appearance.
- **Summer**: The foliage remains a crisp, healthy green that stands up well to heat.
- **Winter**: The bark becomes its most vibrant green, providing a striking contrast against snow or dark evergreens.

## Garden Use & Care
Excellent for adding vertical interest and winter color. It pairs beautifully with its sibling 'Sango Kaku' for a red-and-green bark display.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Pruning**: Responds well to pruning to maintain its upright, vase-like shape.
- **Sun Exposure**: Full sun helps maintain the brightest bark color during the winter months.

> [!TIP]
> Plant 'Aoyagi' against a dark background or near a red-barked cultivar to make its unique green stems truly pop.
