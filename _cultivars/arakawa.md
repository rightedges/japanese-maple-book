## Overview
'Arakawa' translates to "Rough River" or "Rough Skin," and it is famed for its unique bark. As the tree matures (usually starting around year 4-5), the bark develops deep, corky fissures that give it the appearance of an ancient, craggy pine. This makes it a prized specimen for bonsai and winter gardens.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Bark**: The primary feature. The rough, corky texture is unique among maples and provides incredible winter interest.
- **Spring**: Leaves emerge a bright, cheerful green.
- **Fall**: One of the earliest to turn, displaying brilliant shades of glowing orange and red.
- **Vigor**: A very strong, fast-growing grower that establishes quickly.

## Garden Use & Care
Use as a solitary specimen where the bark can be inspected up close. It is tough, heat-tolerant, and easy to grow, making it excellent for beginners.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Pruning**: Because it is so vigorous, it requires regular structural pruning to keep it from becoming messy.
- **Bonsai**: A top-tier choice for bonsai culture due to the "instant age" look provided by the bark.
