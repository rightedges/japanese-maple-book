## Overview
'Orange Dream' is celebrated for its hypnotic seasonal color shifts, emerging in spring with vibrant orange-to-gold foliage. A bushy, slow-growing upright (8-10ft), it has earned the RHS Award of Garden Merit for its reliable performance and luminous chartreuse summer display.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring Emergence**: Fresh golden-yellow leaves with distinct pinkish-orange margins create a "sunrise" effect.
- **Summer Maturation**: Transitions to a cooling lemon yellow or chartreuse. Bright green bark adds a second layer of visual interest to the internal canopy.
- **Fall Peak**: Concludes the season with a brilliant display of yellow-gold to crimson, depending on sun exposure.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal for adding a splash of high-luminosity color to small gardens or as a patio specimen in large containers. Pair with dark evergreens to make the gold foliage "glow."

### Maintenance Tips
- **Light Filter**: Thrives in dappled sunlight; full afternoon sun can scorch the delicate yellow margins during mid-summer heatwaves.
- **Winter Interest**: The green bark provides a refreshing vertical contrast in dormant winter landscapes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain the best orange-gold spring color, ensure it receives morning sun; too much shade will cause the tree to stay a flat green.
