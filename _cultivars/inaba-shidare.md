## Overview
'Inaba shidare' is the "muscular" powerhouse of the red lace-leafs. Prized for its sheer vigor and extraordinary environmental resilience, it features larger, bolder lobes than other dissectums, allowing it to grow faster and withstand more sun and wind.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Emerges as a deep, saturated carmine-purple "cloud" with dark reddish-purple wood.
- **Summer**: Maintains a near-black burgundy color even in 90°F (32°C) sun, thanks to thicker, glossy leaves that resist bleaching.
- **Fall & Winter**: Explosive shift to burning scarlet in autumn. Its thick, flexible branches hold heavy snow better than more brittle varieties.

## Garden Use & Care
Ideal for large landscape focal points or as a "purple waterfall" pouring over slopes and retaining walls. Pair with gold-leaved trees like **'Summer Gold'** for high-contrast drama.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Thinning cuts**: Use summer thinning cuts to prevent "bottom-heavy" growth and redirect energy to the top of the canopy.
- **Mulching**: In Zone 9, use 4 inches of mulch to keep the root zone cool and prevent "bronzing" of the heat-absorbent purple leaves.

> [!TIP]
> If a more delicate 'Crimson Queen' is struggling in your yard, 'Inaba shidare' is the robust "Plan B" that almost always succeeds.
