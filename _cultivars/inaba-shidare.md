## Overview
One of the most vigorous and durable red weeping lace-leaf maples. It features large, deeply dissected purple-red leaves that hold their color remarkably well during the summer.

## Care Tips
- **Sun Tolerance:** Notable for being one of the most sun-tolerant red dissectums, though it still appreciates some afternoon shade in extreme climates.
- **Vigor:** Grows faster than 'Crimson Queen' or 'Tamukeyama', reaching its mature size more quickly.
- **Fall Color:** Shifts to a bright, fiery red in the autumn.
