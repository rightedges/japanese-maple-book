## Overview
One of the first to leaf out in spring, 'Katsura' is stunning with its bright orange-yellow new growth. It eventually settles into a chartreuse green for summer before returning to orange in the fall.

## Care Tips
- **Spring Interest:** Its primary draw is the neon spring flush. Protect from late frosts.
- **Circulation:** Forms a very dense, tiered structure; prune occasionally to improve air circulation and prevent mildew.
- **Siting:** Prefers morning sun and afternoon shade.
