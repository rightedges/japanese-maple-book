## Overview
'Katsura' is the ultimate "harbinger of spring," often waking up weeks before other cultivars. It is celebrated for its enthusiastic display of translucent apricot-orange and chartreuse, providing an "illuminated" signal that winter has ended.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Vibrant apricot-orange leaves with red rims transition to a glowing chartreuse-yellow as they expand.
- **Summer**: Settles into a crisp "Granny Smith" apple green, maintaining a bright luminosity rather than a dark forest tone.
- **Fall & Winter**: Returns to butter-yellow and fiery orange in autumn. Winter reveals tight internodes and a dense, twiggy vertical structure.

## Garden Use & Care
Functions as a perfect "threshold marker" for garden entrances. Its tiered habit of horizontal platforms makes it ideal for courtyard corners. Pair with **Bluebells** or blue-flowered **Brunnera** to make the yellow foliage "glow."

### Maintenance Tips
- **Frost Alert**: Wakes up very early; keep frost cloth ready to protect tender spring flush from late April freezes.
- **Thinning cuts**: Avoid "heading back" branches; use thinning cuts to maintain the natural tiered horizontal planes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dappled shade is essential for the afternoon; full 2 PM sun will "bleach" the delicate chartreuse leaves into a papery brown.
