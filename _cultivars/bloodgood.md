## Overview
'Bloodgood' is the industry benchmark for red-leaved Japanese Maples. Originating from New York's Bloodgood Nursery, it is prized for its vigorous growth, architectural "V" shape, and its legendary ability to hold deep burgundy color even in high-heat summers.

## Key Features & Seasonal Interest
- **Spring**: Bursts with translucent carmine-red leaves that glow in the sunlight.
- **Summer**: Matures to a deep, waxy burgundy that resists "greening out."
- **Fall & Winter**: Sharp transition to bright scarlet in late autumn, followed by a smooth silvery-grey winter silhouette.

## Garden Use & Care
A perfect 15-20 foot residential anchor that provides shade without overwhelming small gardens. Beautiful when paired with golden **Hakone Grass** or lime-green **Hostas**.

### Maintenance Tips
- **Interior Thinning**: Regularly remove interior "twiggy" growth to prevent die-back and fungal issues.
- **Moisture & Mulch**: While sun-tolerant, it requires consistent moisture and mulch to prevent leaf edge "crisping" in Zone 8-9.

> [!TIP]
> In very hot regions, providing 2-3 hours of filtered afternoon light will keep the leaf margins pristine through August.
