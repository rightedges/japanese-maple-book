## Overview
'Bloodgood' is more than just a cultivar; it is the benchmark against which all red-leaved Japanese Maples are measured. For over a century, it has dominated the landscape industry due to a rare combination of sheer vigor, reliable color retention, and architectural elegance. If a gardener mentions a "Red Japanese Maple" without a specific name, nine times out of ten, they are thinking of a 'Bloodgood'.

## 1. Cultural Context & Historical Anecdotes
The origin of 'Bloodgood' takes us back to the early 20th century at the **Bloodgood Nursery** in Long Island, New York. Long before the explosion of boutique nurseries, the Bloodgood family was instrumental in selecting and stabilizing Japanese Maple genetics for the North American climate.

While many European selections of the era were prone to "greening out" in the humid East Coast summers, the 'Bloodgood' selection showed a remarkable ability to maintain its deep blood-red pigment (anthocyanin) through the high UV index of July and August. It was eventually introduced to the international market and remains the most produced and sold cultivar of *Acer palmatum* in history.

## 2. Seasonal Transitions: Layer by Layer
'Bloodgood' offers a dynamic four-season performance that transcends its reputation as a "static" red tree:

- **Spring Emergence**: In early April, the buds swell to a deep purple-black. When they burst, the leaves emerge a brilliant, translucent carmine-red. During this stage, the light-reflecting quality of the new leaves makes the tree appear as if it’s glowing from within.
- **Summer Maturation**: As the leaves harden off in June, they transition to a deep, waxy burgundy. Unlike 'Atropurpureum' (a seed-grown equivalent), 'Bloodgood' stays dark even in the shade. The underside of the leaf remains a contrasting olive-maroon, which creates a shimmering effect in the wind.
- **Autumn Finale**: The fall transition is sharp. The burgundy turns to a bright, shocking scarlet. Because 'Bloodgood' is often the last to drop its leaves in the red group, it provides a final burst of color when other maples have already entered dormancy.
- **Winter Silhouette**: The bark is a smooth, silvery-grey that provides a stark architectural contrast to the dark stems of summer. The branching habit is naturally balanced, forming a wide 'V' shape that holds snow beautifully.

## 3. Design Use & Companion Planting
### Landscape Role
- **The Anchor Specimen**: Its 15-20 foot height makes it the perfect size for a residential anchor. It is large enough to provide shade but small enough that it won't overwhelm a standard garden.
- **Negative Space**: Because of its dark foliage, it "recedes" visually. Use it to create a sense of depth in a small garden by planting it at the back of a border.

### Companion Planting & Understory
Because 'Bloodgood' has a relatively open canopy as it ages, it allows for a lush understory:
- **Textural Contrast**: Pair with the silver fronds of **Japanese Painted Fern** (*Athyrium niponicum*) or the golden blades of **Hakone Grass** (*Hakonechloa macra*).
- **Color Pop**: Place lime-green **Hostas** (such as 'Sum and Substance') directly beneath the drip line. The contrast between the lime green and the burgundy canopy is a classic of Zen design.
- **Spring Bulbs**: Surround the base with white **Daffodils** or blue **Grape Hyacinths**. The bulbs will finish their show just as the 'Bloodgood' leaves begin to unfurl.

## 4. Advanced Horticultural Notes
- **Rootstock Compatibility**: 'Bloodgood' is almost exclusively grafted onto standard *Acer palmatum* rootstock. It is highly compatible, and "graft failure" is rare in this variety. However, always ensure the graft union is 2-3 inches above the soil line to prevent "scion rooting."
- **Mineral Requirements**: While adaptable, 'Bloodgood' shows better color in soils slightly higher in iron and magnesium. A light application of chelated iron in spring can enhance the "blood" intensity of the foliage.
- **Grafting Tip**: For those interested in propagation, 'Bloodgood' scion wood is best collected in late January while the tree is deeply dormant. It has a high success rate for side-veneer grafts.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Variety-Specific Issues
- **Internal Shading**: Because 'Bloodgood' is so vigorous, it produces a lot of interior "twiggy" growth. If not thinned, these internal branches will die back, creating pockets of dead wood that can harbor fungal spores.
- **Verticillium Vulnerability**: Like most Palmatums, it is susceptible to Verticillium wilt. The first sign is often a single branch wilting while the rest of the tree looks healthy. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, which create "soft" growth that is easily compromised by pathogens.
- **Sun Scorch**: Despite its high sun tolerance, 'Bloodgood' leaves can "crisp" if the soil is allowed to dry out completely. Mulch is non-negotiable for this cultivar.

> [!TIP]
> If you live in Zone 8 or 9, 'Bloodgood' will perform best with "filtered" afternoon light. While it *can* handle the sun, the leaf edges will stay much cleaner with 2-3 hours of relief from the 2 PM - 5 PM heat.
