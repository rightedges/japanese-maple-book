## Overview
'Bloodgood' is perhaps the most famous of all red-leaved Japanese Maples. It is a robust, upright tree known for its remarkable ability to retain its deep burgundy color even through the heat of summer.

## Care Tips
- **Soil:** Requires very well-drained soil. Like many maples, it is susceptible to root rot in soggy conditions.
- **Sun:** High sun tolerance, but benefits from some afternoon relief in extremely hot climates.
- **Spacing:** Give it room to reach its 20-foot potential.
